This is to announce the second public release of the festvox project.
The festvox project, based at Carnegie Mellon University, distributes
documentation, scripts and examples that should be sufficient for an
interested person to build their own synthetic voices in currently
supported languages or new languages in the University of Edinburgh's
Festival Speech Synthesis System.  The quality of the result depends
much on the time and skill of the builder.  For English it may be
possible to build a new voice in a couple of days work, a new language
may take months or years to build.

The release includes:
 o Support for designing, recording and autolabelling diphone databases
 o Support for designing, recording and autolabelling unit selection databases
 o Building simple limited domain synthesis engines
 o Support for building rule driven and data driven prosody models
 o Lexicon and building letter to sound rule support
 o Predefined scripts for building new US (and UK) English voices
 o Example diphone and limited domain synthesis databases

Since the last release (Jan 1999) we have added better support for
generating scheme files from skeletons, clear walkthroughs for standard
tasks, as well as improving overall documentation and support.

The complete documentation in html, and in downloadable format including
the scripts and programs necessary to build new voices and example
databases is available from

        http://www.festvox.org

The full distribution is packaged, including postscript and the
generated html, and is available from

        http://www.festvox.org/festvox-1.1/festvox-1.1-beta.tar.gz

LICENCE

This documentation and related scripts is free software, distributed
under an X11-type licence (like Festival itself).  No claims are made
by the authors of this work, Carnegie Mellon University (or the
University of Edinburgh), on the voices that you generate with the
scripts and techniques described within this distribution.

REQUIREMENTS

A Unix Machine (Linux. FreeBSD, Solaris etc) with working audio i/o:
    although there is nothing inheritantly Unix about the scripts, no
    attempt has yet been made about porting this to other platforms
Edinburgh University's Festival Speech Synthesis System and 
The Edinburgh Speech Tools
    This uses speech tools programs and festival itself at various
    stages in builidng voices as well as (of course) for the final
    voices.  Festival and the Edinburgh Speech Tools are available from
       http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival.html
    or
       http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/festival

    It is recommended that you compile your own versions of these
    as you will need the libraries and include files to build some
    programs in festvox.  Also some parts require support for
    the clunits module which is not compiled in by default in the
    standard distributions.
EMU Labeller
    The University of Macquarie's Speech Hearing and Language Research
    Centre distribute labelling tools for speech databases.  We use it
    here for viewing speech, as spectrograms, F0 contours, phone labels etc.
    It is available from 
           http://www.shlrc.mq.edu.au/emu/
    Other waveform labeller/viewers exist and you find them more convinient
    to use but we include support for emulabel as it meets our requirements
    and is freely available.
Patience and understanding
    Building a new voice is a lot of work, and something will probably
    go wrong which may require the repetition of some long boring and
    tedious process.  Even with lots of care a new voice still might 
    just not work.  In distributing this document we hope to increase the
    basic knowledge of synthesis out there and hopefully find people 
    who can improve on this making the processing easier and more reliable
    in the future.

WARNING

This is not a pointy/clicky plug and play program to build new voices.
It is instructions with discussion on the problems and an attempt to
document the expertise we have gained in building other voices.
Although we have tried to automate the task as much as possible this
is no substitute for careful correction and understanding of the
processes involved.  There are significant pointers into the
literature throughout the document that allow for more detailed study
and further reading.  

However, this release does include complete simple walkthroughs of
scripts that can build voices in English with little more than
recording time, by people without knowledge of scheme programming or
speech technology, but the results will be better if you take time
to understand the underlying processes.

Also note there are still unwritten parts of the documentation,
new releases in the future with reduce such parts.
