<P>
In this chapter, we discuss some of the general aspects of building a
new voice for the Festival Speech Synthesis System, and the requirements
involved.  We will outline each part that you must provide in order to
have a complete voice.  There are a number of choices for each part with
each choice requiring a varying amount of work; the ultimate decision of
what you choose is your own based on the resources you wish to commit
and the quality of the voice you wish to build.

The development of the Festival Speech Synthesis System started in
April, 1996, and it quickly became a tool in which new voices could be
built.  That summer, a Masters student (Maria Walters) at Edinburgh
tried to build a Scots Gaelic synthesizer, and, although the project was
never finished, it did point the way to building new voices in Festival.
Later that summer, a Spanish synthesizer was build rather quickly, using
an existing diphone set, and an existing Welsh Gaelic synthesizer was
migrated into Festival without changing any of the basic architecture of
Festival, or of the existing Gaelic synthesizer, though all parts became
external data rather than embedded C code.  The following year, another
Masters student (Argyris Biris), built a Greek synthesizer and a
visiting scholar (Borja Etxebarria) at CSTR, Edinburgh improved the
Spanish and built a Basque synthesizer.  Oregon Graduate Institute
(under the supervision of Mike Macon) further developed new voices,
including ones for American English voices and Mexican Spanish; they,
unlike the prior developments, also included a new waveform synthesizer
(in C++) which they also distribute as a plug-in for Festival.  In the
summer of '98, Dominika Oliver built a Polish synthesizer, and OGI
hosted a six week workshop, with Karin Mueller, Bettina Saeuberlich and
Horst Meyer building two German synthesis voices within the system.

</P>
<P>
In all cases, these new voices consist of a set of diphones and some
scheme code to provide a front end, including text analysis,
pronunciation, and prosody prediction.  The voices are quite separate
from Festival itself, and can be distributed as packages that can be
installed against any installation of Festival.  The voices do not
interfere with any existing, installed voices.

</P>
<P>
The problem is that once people see that new voices can be easily
created, they want to make some also.  Over the initial two and half
years, the processes involved have become easier and more automatic, to
the point where a document specifically describing the processes from a
practical point of view can be written.

</P>
<P>
Note that we do not consider the processes of building a new voice
(either in an existing supported language or in a new language) as
trivial.  It does require choices which we cannot answer for you.  We
think that, given a dedicated person already with experience in speech
processing, computational linguistics and/or programming can probably
build a new voice in a week, though its probably going to take longer
than that.  We are still very far from a state where we can capture a
voice fully automatically from a poor quality microphone on a standard
PC (with the TV in the background) and come up with a voice that sounds
anything near acceptable, though it can be done even on a laptop in a
quiet environment.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX11"></A>
We should state this document does not cover all the background necessary
to understand speech synthesis as a whole, as it is specifically about
building voices in Festival.  This touches on many research issues in
the field and appropriate references are given throughout.  For a good
background in speech synthesis and text-to-speech (TTS) systems in
general see <CITE>dutoit97</CITE>; for a more detailed description of a
particular text-to-speech system (The Bell Labs Text-to-speech system)
see <CITE>sproat98</CITE>, which takes a much more research point of view.

</P>
<P>
This document in itself is not really suitable as the only text for a
course on speech synthesis, but should be a good adjunct to other
materials on synthesis, or in a general speech processing course.  It is
also useful to anyone who would like to build limited domain
synthesizers, or synthesizers from their own voices, and this can be
done with a limited amount of knowledge about the field.  Actually
building a voice is a practical and useful thing to do to understand the
relative complexities of the various modules in the text-to-speech
process.  We do consider this documented suitable for students to use in
synthesis projects, and we have tried to provide at least some
references and background material wherever it seems appropriate.

</P>
<P>
Although the voices that are built following the instructions in this
document, we hope, will useful in themselves, we do expect that those
who build them will learn much more about the text-to-speech process.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC5">3.1  Text-to-speech process</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX12"></A>
<A NAME="IDX13"></A>
Within Festival we can identify three basic parts of the
TTS process
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>Text analysis:</EM>
<DD>
From raw text to identified words and basic utterances.
<DT><EM>Linguistic analysis:</EM>
<DD>
Finding pronunciations of the words and assigning prosodic
structure to them: phrasing, intonation and durations.
<DT><EM>Waveform generation:</EM>
<DD>
From a fully specified form (pronunciation and prosody) generate
a waveform.
</DL>
<P>
These partitions are not absolute, but they are a good way of chunking
the problem.  Of course, different waveform generation techniques may
need different types of information.  <EM>Pronunciation</EM> may not
always use standard phones, and <EM>intonation</EM> need not necessarily
mean an F0 contour.  For the main part, at along least the path which is
likely to generate a working voice, rather than the more research
oriented techniques described, the above three sections will be fairly
cleanly adhered to.

</P>
<P>
There is another part to TTS which is normally not mentioned, we will
mention it here as it is the most important aspect of Festival that
makes building of new voices possible -- the system <EM>architecture</EM>.
Festival provides a basic utterance structure, a language to manipulate
it, and methods for construction and deletion; it also interacts with
your audio system in an efficient way, spooling audio files while the
rest of the synthesis process can continue.  With the Edinburgh Speech
Tools, it offers basic analysis tools (pitch trackers, classification
and regression tree builders, waveform I/O etc) and a simple but
powerful scripting language.  All of these functions make it so that you
may get on with the task of building a voice, rather than worrying about
the underlying software too much.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC6">3.1.1  Text analysis</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX14"></A>
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
Text analysis is the task of identifying the <EM>words</EM> in the text.
By <EM>words</EM>, we mean tokens for which there is a well defined method
of finding their pronunciation, i.e. from a lexicon, or using
letter-to-sound rules.  The first task in text analysis is to make
chunks out of the input text -- <EM>tokenizing</EM> it. In Festival, at this
stage, we also chunk the text into more reasonably sized utterances.  An
utterance structure is used to hold the information for what might most
simply be described as a <EM>sentence</EM>.  We use the term loosely, as
it need not be anything syntactic in the traditional linguistic sense,
though it most often has prosodic boundaries or edge effects.
Separating a text into utterances is important, as it allows synthesis to
work bit by bit, allowing the waveform of the first utterance to be
available more quickly than if the whole files was processed as one.
Otherwise, one would simply play an entire recorded utterance -- which
is not nearly as flexible, and in some domains is even impossible.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
Utterance chunking is an externally specifiable part of Festival, as it
may vary from language to language.  For many languages, tokens are
white-space separated and utterances can, to a first approximation, be
separated after full stops (periods), question marks, or exclamation
points.  Further complications, such as abbreviations, other-end
punctuation (as the upside-down question mark in Spanish), blank lines
and so on, make the definition harder.  For languages such as Japanese
and Chinese, where white space is not normally used to separate what we
would term words, a different strategy must be used, though both these
languages still use punctuation that can be used to identify utterance
boundaries, and word segmentation can be a second process.

</P>
<P>
Apart from chunking, text analysis also does text <EM>normalization</EM>.
There are many tokens which appear in text that do not have 
a direct relationship to their pronunciation.  Numbers are perhaps
the most obvious example.  Consider the following
sentence

<PRE>
On May 5 1996, the university bought 1996 computers.
</PRE>

<P>
In English, tokens consisting of solely digits have a number of different
forms of pronunciation.  The <SAMP>`5'</SAMP> above is pronounced <SAMP>`fifth'</SAMP>, an
ordinal, because it is the day in a month, The first <SAMP>`1996'</SAMP> is
pronounced as <SAMP>`nineteen ninety six'</SAMP> because it is a year, and the
second <SAMP>`1996'</SAMP> is pronounced as <SAMP>`one thousand nine hundred
and ninety size'</SAMP> (British English) as it is a quantity.  

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
Two problems that turn up here: non-trivial relationship of tokens to
words, and <EM>homographs</EM>, where the same token may have alternate
pronunciations in different contexts.  In Festival, homograph
disambiguation is considered as part of text analysis.  In addition to
numbers, there are many other symbols which have internal structure that
require special processing -- such as money, times, addresses, etc.  All
of these can be dealt with in Festival by what is termed
<EM>token-to-word rules</EM>.  These are language specific (and sometimes
text mode specific).  Detailed examples will be given in the text
analysis chapter below.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC7">3.1.2  Linguistic analysis</A></H3>

<P>
In this section, we consider both word pronunciation and prosody.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
We assume that (largely) words have been properly identified at this
stage, and their pronunciation can be found by looking them up in a
lexicon, or by applying some form of letter-to-sound rules to the
letters in the word.  We will present methods for automatically building
letter-to-sound rules later in this document.  For most languages, a
machine-readable lexicon with pronunciation (and possibly lexical
stress) will be necessary.  A second stage in pronunciation invokes
modifications to standard pronunciations when they appear in continuous
speech.  Some pronunciations change depending on the context they are
in; for example, in British English, word final /r/ is only pronounced
if the following word is vowel initial.  These phenomena are dealt with
by <EM>post-lexical rules</EM>, where modification of the standard lexical
form is depends on the context that the word appears in.

</P>
<P>
By prosody, we mean, put far too simply, phrasing, duration, intonation,
and power.  For many languages, intonation can be split into two stages,
accent placement and F0 contour generation.  Prosodic models are both
language- and speaker-dependent, and we present methods to help build
models.  Some of the models we present are very simple, and don't
necessarily sound good, but they may be adequate for your task; other
methods are more involved and require more effort.  Considering that,
even for well researched languages like English, good, vivacious
prosodic modeling is still an unreached goal, simpler, more limited
models are often reasonable, unless you wish to undertake a significant
amount of new research.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC8">3.1.3  Waveform generation</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
We will primarily be presenting concatenative methods for waveform
generation, where we collect databases of real speech, and select
appropriate units and concatenate them.  These selected units are then
typically altered by some form of signal processing function to change
the pitch and duration.  Concatenative synthesis is not the only method
of waveform synthesis, another two models are <EM>formant</EM> synthesis,
as in MITalk <CITE>allen87</CITE> and <CITE>hertz90</CITE>, and <EM>articulatory
synthesis</EM>.  These three methods come from quite different directions
though ultimately, we believe, will be joined together in a hybrid model
of speech parameterization, trained from real data conjoined in
non-trivial ways. There's plenty of research to be done.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX26"></A>
The methods presented in this document are less ambitious in their
research goals.  We cover the tasks involved in building diphone
databases, limited domain synthesizers, and more general databases.  It
is possible to use external processes to Festival to perform waveform
synthesis -- the MBROLA system <CITE>dutoit96</CITE> offers diphone databases
for many language languages.  Festival can be used to provided text and
linguistic analysis while MBROLA can be used to generate the waveform,
if it already supports the language you wish to synthesize.

</P>
<P>
Given that database collection does require significant resources, an
existing voice can, in a pinch, speak another language.  It retains
many properties of the original language, but it may offer a quick and
easy method to get synthesis in that new language.  New languages
can also be created with the aid of an existing synthesizer, by
using it to get alignments for the new language.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC9">3.2  Requirements</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
This section identifies the basic requirements for building a voice
in a new language, and adding a new voice in a language already
supported by Festival.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC10">3.2.1  Hardware/software requirements</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
Because we are most familiar with a Unix environment the scripts, tools
etc. assume such a basic environment.  This is not to say you couldn't
run these scripts on other platforms as many of these tools are
supported on platforms like WIN32, its just that in our normal work
environment, Unix is ubiquitous and we like working in it.  Festival
also runs on Win32 platforms.

</P>
<P>
Much of the testing was done under Linux; wherever possible,
we are using freely available tools. We are happy to say that
no non-free tools are required to build voices, and we have
included citations and/or links to everything needed in this
document.

</P>
<P>
We assume Festival 1.4.1 and the Edinburgh Speech Tools 1.2.1.

</P>
<P>
Note that we make an extensive use of the Speech Tools programs, and you
will need the full distribution of them as well as Festival, rather than
the run-time (binary) only versions which are available for some Linux
platforms.  If you find the task of compiling Festival and the speech
tools daunting, you will probably find the rest of the tasks specified
in this document more so.  However, it is not necessary for you to have
any knowledge of C++ to make voices, though familiarity with text
processing techniques (e.g. awk, sed, perl) will make understanding the
examples given much easier.

</P>
<P>
We also assume a basic knowledge of Festival, and of speech processing
in general.  We expect the reader to be familiar with basic terms such as
<EM>F0</EM>, <EM>phoneme</EM>, and <EM>cepstrum</EM>, but not in any real
detail.  References to general texts are given (when we know them to
exist).  A basic knowledge of programming in Scheme (and/or Lisp) will
also make things easier.  A basic capability in programming in general
will make defining rules, etc., much easier.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
If you are going to record your own database, you will need recording
equipment: the higher quality, the better.  A proper recording studio is
ideal, though may not be available for everyone.  A cheap microphone
stuck on the back of standard PC is not ideal, though we know most of
you will end up doing that.  A high quality sound board, close-talking,
high-quality microphone and a nearly soundproof recording environment
will often be the compromise between these two extremes.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
Many of the techniques described in here require a fair amount of
processing time to achieve, though machines are indeed getting faster
and this is becoming less of an issue.  If you use the provided aligner
for labelling diphones you will need a processor of reasonable speed,
likewise for the various training techniques for intonation, duration
modeling and letter-to-sound rules.  Nothing presented here takes weeks
though a number of processes may be over-night jobs, depending on the
speed of your machine.

</P>
<P>
Also we think that you will need a little patience.  The process of
building a voice is not necessarily going to work first time.  It may
even fail completely, so if you don't expect anything special, you wont
be disappointed.  

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC11">3.2.2  Voice in a new language</A></H3>

<P>
The following list is a basic check list of the core areas you will need
to provide pieces for.  You may, in some cases, get away with very
simple solutions (e.g. fixed phone durations), or be able to borrow from
other voices/languages, but whatever you end up doing, you will need to
provide something for each part.

</P>
<P>
You will need to define 

<UL>
<LI>Phone set

<LI>Token processing rules (numbers etc)

<LI>Prosodic phrasing method

<LI>Word pronunciation (lexicon and/or letter-to-sound rules)

<LI>Intonation (accents and F0 contour)

<LI>Durations

<LI>Waveform synthesizer

</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC12">3.2.3  Voice in an existing language</A></H3>

<P>
The most common case is when someone wants to make their own voice into
a synthesizer.  Note that the issues in voice modeling of a particular
speaker are still open research problems. Much of the quality of a
particular voice comes mostly from the waveform generation method, but
other aspects of a speaker such as intonation and duration, and
pronunciation are all part of what makes that person's voice sound like
them.  All of the general-purpose voices we have heard in Festival sound
like the speaker they were record from (at least as far as we know all
the speakers), but they also don't have all the qualities of that
person's voice, though they can be quite convincing for limited-domain
synthesizers.

</P>
<P>
As a practical recommendation to make a new speaker in an existing
supported language, you will need to consider

<UL>
<LI>Waveform synthesis

<LI>Speaker specific intonation

<LI>Speaker specific duration

</UL>

<P>
section <A HREF="festvox_9.html#SEC52">9.10  US/UK English Walkthrough</A> deals with specifically building
a new US or UK English voice.  This is a relatively easy place to start,
though of course we encourage reading this entire document.

</P>
<P>
Another possible solution to getting a new or particular voice is to do
voice conversion, as is done at the Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI)
<CITE>kain98</CITE> and elsewhere. OGI have already released new voices based
on this conversion and may release the conversion code itself, though
the license terms are not the same as those of Festival or this document.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
Another aspect of a new voice in an existing language is a voice in a
new dialect.  The requirements are similar to those of creating a voice
in a new language.  The lexicon and intonation probably need to change
as well as the waveform generation method (a new diphone database).
Although much of the text analysis came probably be borrowed, be aware
that simple things like number pronunciation can often change between
dialects (cf. US and UK English).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
We also do work on limited domain synthesis in the same framework.  For
limited domain synthesis, a reasonably small corpus is collected, and
used to synthesize a much larger range of utterances in the same basic
style.  We give an example of recording a talking clock, which, although
built from only 24 recordings, generates over a thousand unique
utterances; these capture a lot of the latent speaker characteristics
from the data.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC13">3.3  Future</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
There is still much to be added to this document, both from the
practical aspect of documenting currently known techniques for modeling
voices, and also new research to make such modeling both better and more
reliable.

</P>
<P>
Both these aspects are being considered, and we intend to regularly
update this document as new techniques become more stable, and we get
around to documenting and testing things which should be in this
document already.

</P>

<UL>
<LI>Support basic prosodic characteristics of a new (English) speaker.

Most of the scripts (brazenly) have the pitch range hardwired to a
default (for male speech).  It would be fairly easy to record a short
section of speech from a speaker and set these automatically.  Secondly
extracting some basic information about speech rate, and pitch mean and
range of a speaker is well within the current programs.
<LI>Integrate the NSW (Non-standard word) text analysis system.

The Johns Hopkins University summer workshop 99, had a project on
analysis of non-standard words (NSW)
(<A HREF="http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/ws99/projects/normal/">http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/ws99/projects/normal/</A>).  The results of
this project were later released fully within a Festival framework.
Proper integration of that analysis system, with the addition of the
appropriate taring tools and documentation fits well within the Festvox
project and should happen soon.
<LI>The introduction of <CODE>festlang</CODE> module that allows language

support to be distribution/used as a distinct module from a voice or
lexicon and so can be shared between languages.  This has almost
happened but not quite formalised yet.
<LI>Better support for autolabeled segments and prosody.  There

is now a free speech recognition system (CMU Sphinx 
<A HREF="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/">http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/sphinx/</A>) which should offer
better segmental labelling for continuous speech (i.e. limited
domain and unit selection databases).  Some documentation and testing
of this should be included.  Likewise better prosody labelling (which
is perhaps more research oriented) is required, though duration (as
opposed to F0) should be possible now.
<LI>A number of new experiments have been made in improving the

cluster unit selection system that haven't been properly folded into
this release.  They don't yet solve all problems but do reduce the
problems.
<LI>Better documentation on audio devices would be useful.  We

know many problems will be caused by inadequate diagnosis of audio
recording quality.
<LI>Better pitchmark extraction from waveforms.  This isn't too

difficult as a signal processing task and we should spend some resources
of it as it is likely to be one of the key problems in generated
synthesis quality.
