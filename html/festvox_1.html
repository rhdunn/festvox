<P>
This document provides documentation for the processes and
issues in building a new voice in the Festival Speech
Synthesis System.  This covers the necessary stages in building
a voice either in an already supported language or in a completely
new language.

</P>
<P>
Although the task of building very high quality generalized text to
speech voices is still very difficult with many open research
questions, we believe the building of reasonable quality voices,
acceptable for many tasks, can be done with the information provided
within this document.  Already Festival has been used to implement a
number of different languages and voices, including: English (US and
UK), Spanish (Castillean and Mexican), German, Polish, Greek, Welsh
Gaelic and Basque.  These voices were often built in very short times (a
few weeks) by people with only minimal knowledge of speech synthesis
(e.g. Master's students).  Although the quality varies, the results all
produced text to speech synthesizers of a quality capable of reading
text, like online newspapers, at a level that native speakers can easily
follow.
