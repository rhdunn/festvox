<P>
This document provides documentation for the processes and
issues in building a new voice in the Festival Speech
Synthesis System.  This covers the necessary stages in building
a voice either in an already supported language or in a completely
new language.

</P>
<P>
Although the task of building very high quality, general text-to-speech
(TTS) voices is still a difficult one, with many open research
questions, we believe the building of reasonable quality voices for many
tasks can be done with the information provided within this document.  A
number of different languages and voices have already been implemented
under Festival, including: US and UK English, Castillian and Mexican
Spanish, German, Polish, Greek, Welsh Gaelic, and Basque.  These were
often built in a short time, some in a just few weeks, by people
starting with only a little knowledge of speech synthesis.  Although the
quality varies, all have produced text-to-speech synthesizers capable of
reading text, like online newspapers, at a level that native speakers
can easily follow.

Synthesis System itself, and we assume that the user has access to the
Festival system and the Edinburgh Speech Tools.  Except where explicitly
mentioned constructing voices can be done using these tools alone.
