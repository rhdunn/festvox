<P>
The authors of this document, Carnegie Mellon University and the
University of Edinburgh make no further claim on any voices built using
the information in this document.  Voices built using the information in
this document are the responsibility of the builders.  Any restrictions
on the distribution, rights and ownership of the voices are a direct
consequence of the actual resources that go in them.  

</P>
<P>
As Festival and the documentation and scripts that are part of festvox
are free to be used for commercial and non-commercial projects alike.
We believe we have delivered sufficient instructions and tools for you to
build your voices free from any restriction imposed by us (CMU or
Edinburgh).  Thus if you wish to create a proprietary voice Festival and
Festvox tools will not inhibit that, but of course you must ensure you
have rights from other resources you use such as, lexicons, display
tools etc.
