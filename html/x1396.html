>The basic assumption in Festival is that you will have a large lexicon, 
tens of thousands of entries, that is a used as a standard part of an 
implementation of a voice. Letter-to-sound rules are used as back up 
when a word is not explicitly listed. This view is based on how English 
is best dealt with. However this is a very flexible view, An explicit 
lexicon isn't necessary in Festival and it may be possible to do much of 
the work in letter-to-sound rules. This is how we have implemented 
Spanish. However even when there is strong relationship between the 
letters in a word and their pronunciation we still find the a lexicon 
useful. For Spanish we still use the lexicon for symbols such as 
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>$</I
>"</SPAN
>, <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>%</I
>"</SPAN
>, individual letters, as well as irregular 
pronunciations. </P
><P
>In addition to a large lexicon Festival also supports a smaller list 
called an <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>addenda</I
> this is primarily provided to allow specific 
applications and users to add entries that aren't in the existing 
lexicon. </P
