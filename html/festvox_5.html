<H1><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC22">5  Diphone databases</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter describes the processes involved in designing, listing
recording, and using a diphone database for a language.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC23">5.1  Diphone introduction</A></H2>

<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
The basic idea behind building diphone databases is to explicitly list
all possible phone-phone transitions in a language.  This makes the
wrong, but practical, assumption that co-articulatory effects never go
over more than two phones.  The exact definition of <EM>phone</EM>
here is in general non-trivial as in addition to what one may define as
a standard phone set, various allophonic variation may in some cases be
also included.  Unlike generalized unit selection where multiple
occurrences of phones may exists with various distinguishing features, in
a diphone database only one occurrence of each diphone is recorded.  This
makes selection much easier but also makes for a large laborious
collection task.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
In general the number of diphones in a language is the number of phones
squared.  However often there are various restrictions in phone-phone
combinations and whole classes of phones-phone combinations may be
deemed never to exist.  The exact definition of <EM>never exist</EM> is
problematic.  Humans can often generate those so-called non-existent
diphones if they try and one must always think about phone-phone
transitions over word boundaries as well but even then certain
combinations cannot exist for example /hh/ /ng/ in English probably
impossible (if forced we would probably insert a schwa).  /ng/ may
really only appear in coda position, however, in foreign words it can
appear in syllable initial position.  /hh/ cannot appear in syllable
final position, though sometimes it may be pronounced when trying to add
aspiration to open vowels.

</P>
<P>
Diphone synthesis, and in general any concatenative synthesis
method, make an absolute fixed choice about which units exist
and in circumstances where something else is required a mapping
is necessary.  When humans speak and are given a context where
an unusual phone is desired they will (often) attempt to produce it
even though it falls outside their basic phonetic vocabulary.  Humans
of course have an articulatory system which allows them enough control
to produce (or attempt to produce) unfamiliar phones.  Concatenative
synthesizers however make a fixed decision and they cannot reasonably
produce anything outside their pre-defined vocabulary.  Formant 
and articulatory synthesizers of course have the advantage here.  

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
However because we wish to build voices for arbitrary text to speech
systems which may include unusual phones some mapping (typically at the
lexical level) can be used to ensure all actually required diphones lie
within the recorded inventory.  The resulting voice will therefore
be limited and not compensate for unusual phones that lie outside
its range.  This in many cases if acceptable though if the
voice is specifically to be used for pronouncing Scottish place
names it would be advisable to include the /X/ phone as in "loch".

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX93"></A>
In addition to what may be considered as basic phones, various
allophonic variations may also be considered.  Flaps in American English
are a good example of a reduction which makes speech more natural.
Stressed and unstressed vowels in Spanish, consonant cluster /r/ verses
lone /r/ in English, inter-syllabic diphones verses intra-syllabic ones.
All these variations are worth considering.  Ideally all such possible
variations should be included in a diphone list but the more variations
you include the larger the diphone set.  This includes recording time,
labelling time and ultimate database size.  Adding an extra phone will
add another 2n diphones (where n is the number of phones).  Duplicating
all the vowels (e.g. stressed/unstressed versions) could significantly
increase the database size.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>
<A NAME="IDX96"></A>
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
These questions are open and depending on resources you are willing
to devote, more and more variations can be added.  However this
list should be seen as a basic set.  Alternative synthesis methods
may produce better results for the amount of work (or data collected).
demi-syllable based databases or mixed inventory methods
such as Hadifix <CITE>portele96</CITE> may give better results.  Still controlling
the inventory but using acoustic measures rather than linguistic
knowledge to define the space of possible units in your inventory 
is work like Whistler <CITE>huang97</CITE>.  The most extreme view where
the unit inventory is not predefined at all but based solely on
what is available in general speech databases is CHATR <CITE>campbell96</CITE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
Although generalized unit selection can produce <EM>much</EM> better
synthesis than diphone techniques, the cost of using more units is the
increase in complexity in selecting appropriate ones.  In the basic
strategy presented in this section selection of the appropriate unit
from the diphone inventory is trivial while in a system like CHATR
selection of the appropriate unit is a significantly difficult problem.
(See section <A HREF="festvox_6.html#SEC34">6  Unit selection databases</A> for more discussion of such
techniques).  With a harder selection task it is more likely that
mistakes will be made which in unit selection can given some selections
which are significanlt worse that diphones, even some examples may be
better.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC24">5.2  Defining a diphone list</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
Because diphones need to be cleanly articulated various techniques have
been proposed to elicit them from subjects.  One technique uses words
within carrier sentences to ensure that the diphones are pronounced
with acceptable duration and prosody (i.e. consistent).  At the
University of Edinburgh we have typically used nonsense words that
iterate through all possible combinations.  The advantage of nonsense
words is that you don't need to search for natural examples that have
the desired diphone, the list can be more easily checked and the
presentation is less prone to pronunciation errors than if real words
were presented.  The words look unnatural but collecting all diphones in
not a particularly natural thing to do. See <CITE>isard86</CITE> or
<CITE>stella83</CITE> for some more discussion on the use of nonsense words
for collecting diphones.

</P>
<P>
For best results we believe the words should be pronounced with the same
vocal effort, with as little prosodic variation as possible.  In fact
pronouncing them in a monotone is ideal.  Our nonsense words consist of
a simple carrier form with the diphones (where appropriate) being taken
from a middle syllable.  Except where schwa and syllabic consonants are
involved that syllable should normally be a full stressed one.  

</P>
<P>
Some example code is given in <TT>`src/diphone/darpaschema.scm'</TT>.  The
basic idea is to define classes of diphones, for example: vowel consonant,
consonant vowel, vowel vowel and consonant consonant.  Then define
carrier contexts for these and list the cases.  Here we use Festival's
Scheme interpreter to generate the list though any scripting language is
suitable.  Our intention is that the diphone will come from a middle
syllable of the nonsense word so it is fully articulated and minimize
the articulatory effects at the start and end of the word.

</P>
<P>
For example to generate all vowel vowel diphone we define
a carrier 

<PRE>
(set! vv-carrier '((pau t aa t) (t aa pau)))
</PRE>

<P>
And we define a simple function that will enumerate all 
vowel vowel transitions

<PRE>
(define (list-vvs)
  (apply
   append
   (mapcar
    (lambda (v1)
      (mapcar 
       (lambda (v2) 
         (list
          (string-append v1 "-" v2)
          (append (car vv-carrier) (list v1 v2) (car (cdr vv-carrier)))))
       vowels))
    vowels)))
</PRE>

<P>
For those of you who aren't used to reading Lisp this simple
lists all possible combinations or in some potentially more
readable format (in an imaginary language)

<PRE>
for v1 in vowels
   for v2 in vowels
     print pau t aa t $v1 $v2 t aa pau
</PRE>

<P>
The actual Lisp code returns a list of diphone names and phone string.
To be more efficient the darpa example produces consonant-vowel
and vowel-consonant diphones in the same nonsense word thus
reducing the number of words quite significantly.

</P>
<P>
Although the idea seems simple to begin with, simply listing
all contexts and pairs, there are other constraints.   Some
consonants can only appear in onset position while others are
restricted to the coda. 

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
Next there is the issue about collecting diphones for more than simply
all phone-phone pairs.  Consonant clusters are the obvious next set to
consider.  the /p/ in <CODE>pat</CODE> isn't really the same as the /p/ in
<CODE>prat</CODE>.  Thus the example darpa schema include simple consonant
clusters with explicit syllable boundaries.  We also include
syllabic consonants though these may be harder to pronounce in all
contexts.  You can also add other phenomena but this is at
the cost of not only making the list longer and hence taking
longer to record, but also you must consider how easy it is
for your speaker to pronounce them (and how consistent they
can be).  For example not all American speaker produce flaps (/dx/)
in all contexts and its quite difficult for some to pronounce them
so some of the nonsense words they produce could be wrong.  

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
A second related problem is language interference and phoneme crossover.
Because of the prevalence of English, especially in electronic text, how
many "foreign" phone should be considered.  For example should /w/ be
include for German speakers, (maybe), /t-i/ for Japanese (probably) or
both /b/ and /v/ for Spanish speakers.  This problem is made difficult
by the fact that the people you are recording will often be fluent or
near fluent in English and hence already have reasonably ability in
phones that are not in their native language.  To some degree foreign
phones should be considered if the text that will be spoken will contain
loan words that would normally require them, remember that in most
languages, nowadays, making no attempt to accommodate foreign phones is
considered ignorant at least and possibly even arrogant.

</P>
<P>
Ultimately when more complex forms are desired extending the
"diphone" set becomes prohibitive and has diminishing returns.
Obviously there are phonetic differences between onset and coda
positions, co-articulatory effects which go over more then one
phone, stress differences, intonational accent differences, 
phrase final, middle and initial difference to name but a few.
Explicitly enumerating all these or even deciding on which is
more important than others is a difficult research question
and arguably shouldn't be done in an abstract linguistically
generated fashion.   Identifying these potential differences and
finding an inventory which takes into account the actual distinctions
a speaker makes is far more productive and is the fundamental part
of many new research directions in concatenative speech synthesis.
(See the discussion in the introduction above).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
However you choose to construct your diphone list and whatever examples
you choose to include you should (if you wish to use the other tools and
scripts included with this document) construct a file of the following
format.  Each line should contain a file id, a diphone name (or list of
names if more than one diphone is being extracted from that file) and a
list of phones in the nonsense word.  The file id is used to in the
filename for the waveform, label file, and any other parameters files
associated with the nonsense word.  We usually make this distinct for
the particular speaker we are going to record, e.g. their initials and
possible the language they are speaking.  For example the following is
taken from the darpa generated list

<PRE>
( awb_0001 ("b-aa" "aa-b")  (pau t aa b aa b aa pau) )
( awb_0002 ("p-aa" "aa-p")  (pau t aa p aa p aa pau) )
( awb_0003 ("d-aa" "aa-d")  (pau t aa d aa d aa pau) )
( awb_0004 ("t-aa" "aa-t")  (pau t aa t aa t aa pau) )
( awb_0005 ("g-aa" "aa-g")  (pau t aa g aa g aa pau) )
( awb_0006 ("k-aa" "aa-k")  (pau t aa k aa k aa pau) )
...
( awb_0466 "eh-aa"          (pau t aa t eh aa t aa pau) )
( awb_0467 "eh-ae"          (pau t aa t eh ae t aa pau) )
( awb_0468 "eh-ah"          (pau t aa t eh ah t aa pau) )
...
( awb_0621 "p-v"            (pau t aa p - v aa t aa pau) )
( awb_0622 "p-s"            (pau t aa p - s aa t aa pau) )
( awb_0623 "p-z"            (pau t aa p - z aa t aa pau) )
( awb_0624 "p-sh"           (pau t aa p - sh aa t aa pau) )
( awb_0627 "p-r"            (pau t aa p - r aa t aa pau) )
...
</PRE>

<P>
Note the explicit syllable boundary marking <CODE>-</CODE> for the consonant
consonant diphones is used to distinguish them from the consonant
cluster examples that appear later.

<H3><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC25">5.2.1  Synthesizing prompts</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX106"></A>
To help keep pronunciation consistent we suggest synthesizing prompts.
This helps the speaker in two ways, if they mimic the prompt they are
more likely to keep a fixed prosody and secondly it reduces the number
of errors where the speaker vocalizes the wrong diphone.  Of course for
new languages where a set of diphones doesn't already exists, producing
prompts is not easy, however giving approximations with diphone sets
from other languages may work.  The problem then is that in producing
prompts from a different phone set, the speaker is likely to mimic the
prompts hence the diphone set will probably seem to have a foreign
pronunciation, especially for vowels section <A HREF="festvox_11.html#SEC77">11.1  Selecting a speaker</A>.

</P>
<P>
Even when synthesizing prompts from an existing diphone set you must be
aware that that diphone set may contain errors or that certain examples
will not be synthesized appropriately (e.g. consonant clusters).
Because of this, it is still worthwhile monitoring the speaker to ensure
they say things correctly.

</P>
<P>
The basic code for generating the prompts is in
<TT>`src/diphone/diphlist.scm'</TT>, and a specific example for darpa phone
set (American English) in <TT>`src/diphone/us_schema.scm'</TT>.  The
prompts can be generated from the diphone list as described above (or at
the same time).  The example code produces the prompts and phone labels
files which can be used by the aligning tool described below.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX107"></A>
<A NAME="IDX108"></A>
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
Before synthesizing, the function <CODE>Diphone_Prompt_Setup</CODE> is
called, if defined.   You should define this to setup the
appropriate voices in Festival as well as any other setup
that may be required, for example setting the F0 for the monotonic
prosody.  This value is set through the variable <CODE>FP_F0</CODE> and
should be in the middle of the range for the speaker.
For example for the darpa diphone list for KAL.

<PRE>
(define (Diphone_Prompt_Setup)
 "(Diphone_Prompt_Setup)
Called before synthesizing the prompt waveforms.  Defined for KAL
speaker using ked diphone set (US English) and setting F0."
 (voice_ked_diphone)  ;; US male voice
 (set! FP_F0 90)      ;; lower F0 than ked
 )
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
Also if the function <CODE>Diphone_Prompt_Word</CODE> is defined it will
be called after the basic prompt word utterance has been created
and before the actual waveform synthesis.  This may be used to
map phones to other phones, set durations or whatever you feel
appropriate for your speaker/diphone set.  For example for the
KAL set we redefined the syllabic consonants to their full
consonant forms because the ked diphone database doesn't actually
include syllabics.  Also in the below example instead of using 
fixed (100ms) durations we make the diphones use their average
duration (but also make it 1.2 times their basic average).

<PRE>
(define (Diphone_Prompt_Word utt)
  "(Diphone_Prompt_Word utt)
Specify specific modifications of the utterance before synthesis
specific to this particular phone set."
  ;; No syllabics in ked so flip them to non-syllabic form
  (mapcar
   (lambda (s)
     (let ((n (item.name s)))
       (cond
        ((string-equal n "el")
         (item.set_name s "l"))
        ((string-equal n "em")
         (item.set_name s "m"))
        ((string-equal n "en")
         (item.set_name s "n")))))
   (utt.relation.items utt 'Segment))
  (set! phoneme_durations kd_durs)
  (Parameter.set 'Duration_Stretch '1.2)
  (Duration_Averages utt))
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
By convention the prompt waveforms should be saved in
<TT>`prompt-wav/'</TT> and their labels in <TT>`prompt-lab/'</TT>.
The prompts may be generated when the diphone list is generated
by the following command

<PRE>
$ festival bin/us_chema.scm bin/diphlist.scm
festival&#62; (diphone-gen-schema "kal" \"etc/kaldiph.list")
</PRE>

<P>
If you already have a diphone list schema generated in the file 
<TT>`etc/kaldiphlist'</TT> you can do the following

<PRE>
$ festival bin/us_schema.scm bin/diphlist.scm
festival&#62; (diphone-gen-waves "prompt-wav" "prompt-lab" "etc/kaldiph.list")
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
Another example of the use of these set up functions is to generate
prompts for a language for which there doesn't yet exists a synthesizer.
A simple mapping can be provided between the target
phoneset and an existing synthesizer's phone set.  We don't know
if this will be sufficient to actually use as prompts but it
appears it is suitable to use these prompts for automatic alignment.

</P>
<P>
The example here is using the <CODE>voice_kal_diphone</CODE> speaker,
a US English speaker, to produce prompts for japanese phone set,
this code is in <TT>`src/diphones/ja_schema.scm'</TT>

</P>
<P>
The function <CODE>Diphone_Prompt_Setup</CODE> calls the kal (US)
sets a suitable F0 value, and sets the option
<CODE>diph_do_db_boundaries</CODE> to <CODE>nil</CODE>.  This option allows
the diphone boundaries to be dumped into the prompt label files,
but this doesn't work when cross language prompting is done as the
actual phones don't match the desired ones.

<PRE>
(define (Diphone_Prompt_Setup)
 "(Diphone_Prompt_Setup)
Called before synthesizing the prompt waveforms.  Cross language prompts
from US male (for gaijin male)."
 (voice_kal_diphone)  ;; US male voice
 (set! FP_F0 90)
 (set! diph_do_db_boundaries nil) ;; cross-lang confuses this
 )
</PRE>

<P>
At synthesis time, each Japanesephone must be mapped to an equivalent
(one or more) US phone.  This is done though a simple table.   set in
<CODE>nhg2radio_map</CODE> which gives the closest phone or phones for
the Japanese phone (those unlisted remain the same).

</P>
<P>
Our mapping table looks like this

<PRE>
(set! nhg2radio_map
      '((a aa)
	(i iy)
	(o ow)
	(u uw)
	(e eh)
	(ts t s)
	(N n)
	(h hh)
	(Qk k)
	(Qg g)
	(Qd d)
	(Qt t)
	(Qts t s)
	(Qch t ch)
	(Qj jh)
	(j jh)
	(Qs s)
	(Qsh sh)
	(Qz z)
	(Qp p)
	(Qb b)
	(Qky k y)
	(Qshy sh y)
	(Qchy ch y)
	(Qpy p y ))
	(ky k y)
	(gy g y)
	(jy jh y)
	(chy ch y)
	(shy sh y)
	(hy hh y)
	(py p y)
	(by b y)
	(my m y)
	(ny n y)
	(ry r y)))
</PRE>

<P>
We assume that those phones not explicitly mentioned map to
themselves (e.g. most of the consonants).

</P>
<P>
Finally we define <CODE>Diphone_Prompt_Word</CODE> to actually do the mapping.
Where the mapping involves more than one US phone we add an extra 
segment to the Segment relation and split the duration equally between
them.  The basic function looks like

<PRE>
(define (Diphone_Prompt_Word utt)
  "(Diphone_Prompt_Word utt)
Specify specific modifications of the utterance before synthesis
specific to this particular phone set."
  (mapcar
   (lambda (s)
     (let ((n (item.name s))
	   (newn (cdr (assoc_string (item.name s) nhg2radio_map))))
       (cond
	((cdr newn)  ;; its a dual one
	 (let ((newi (item.insert s (list (car (cdr newn))) 'after)))
	   (item.set_feat newi "end" (item.feat s "end"))
	   (item.set_feat s "end"
			  (/ (+ (item.feat s "segment_start")
				(item.feat s "end"))
			     2))
	   (item.set_name s (car newn))))
	(newn
	 (item.set_name s (car newn)))
	(t
	 ;; as is
	 ))))
   (utt.relation.items utt 'Segment))
  utt)
</PRE>

<P>
The label file produded from this will have the original desired
language phones, while the waveform will actually consist of phones in
the foreign language.  Although this may seem like cheating we found
that this works over at least Korean and Japanese from English, and is
likely to work over many other language combination pairs.  For
autolabelling as the nonse word phone names are pre-defined alignment
just needs to be the best matching path and as long as the phones are
distinctive from the ones around them this alignment method is
likely to work.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC26">5.3  Recording the diphones</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
See the general notes on speaker selection and recording in the previous
chapter.  But lets reiterate some points.  The object of recording
diphones is to get as uniform a set of pronunciations as possible.
Your speaker should be relaxed, not be suffering for a cold, or
cough, or a hangover.  If something goes wrong with the recording
and some of the examples need to be re-recorded it is important
that the speaker has as similar a voice as with the original
recording, waiting for another cold to come along is not reasonable,
(though some may argue that the same hangover can easily be induced).
Also to try to keep the voice potentially repeatable it is wise
to record at the same time of day, morning is a good idea.

</P>
<P>
The recording environment should be repeatable, which basically means as
defined as possible.  Anechoic chambers are best, but general recording
studios will do.  We've even done recording in an open room, with care
this works (make sure there's little background noise from computers,
ait conditioning, outside traffic etc).  Of course open rooms
aren't ideal but they are better than open noisey rooms.

</P>
<P>
The distance between the speaker and the microphone is crucial.  A head
mounted mike keeps this constant.  Considering the cost and availability
of headmounted mike's you have no excuse not to meet this criteria.

</P>
<P>
Ultimately you need to split the recordings into individual files, one
for each nonsense word.  Ideally this can be done while recording but as
that may not be practical in some (many ?) cases some other technique is
required.  At CSTR we typically record onto DAT and transfer the data to
disk (and down sample) later.  Files typically contain 50-100 nonsense
words each.  We hand label the words taking into account any duplicates
caused be errors in the recording.  The EST program <TT>`ch_wave'</TT>
offers a function to split a large file into individual files based on a
label file.  We can use this to get our individual files.  Others (OGI)
add an identifiable noise during recording and automatically detect that
as a split point.  They typically use two different noises that can
easily be distinguished and use one for <SAMP>`OK'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`BAD'</SAMP> this
can make the splitting of the files into the individual nonsense words
easier.  Note you that will also need to split the EGG signal exactly
the same way.

</P>
<P>
No matter how you split these you should be aware that there will still
often be mistakes and checking by listening will help. 

</P>
<P>
We are no moving towards recording directly to machines, see
section <A HREF="festvox_11.html#SEC79">11.3  Recording under Unix</A>.  There is a cost in the (potential) quality
of the recording due to poorly quality audio hardware in computers (and
often too much noise).  But the advantage of being able to record
directly into the appropriate files is not to be belittled.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC27">5.4  Labelling the diphones</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
Labelling nonsense words is <EM>much</EM> easier than labelling
continuous speech, whether it is by hand or automatic.  With
nonsense words it is completely defined which phones are there
(and if not it is an error) and they are clearly articulated.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
We have had significant experience in hand labelling diphones and with
the right tools it can be done fairly quickly (e.g. 20 hours for 2500
nonsense words) even if it is mind-numbingly boring and can't
realistically be done for more than an hour at any one time.  As a
minimum, the start of the preceding phone to the first phone in the
diphone, the changeover, and the end of the second phone in the diphone
should be labelled.  Note we recommend phone boundary labelling as that
is much better defined than phone middle marking.  The diphone will, by
default be extracted from the middle of phone one to the middle of phone
two.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX117"></A>
<A NAME="IDX118"></A>
Our (hand) labelling conventions include labelling of closures within
stops explicitly.  Thus we expect the label <CODE>tcl</CODE> at the end of the
silence part of a /t/ and a label <CODE>t</CODE> after the burst.  This way we
can automatically make the diphone boundary within the silence part of
the stop.  Also we support the label <CODE>DB</CODE> when explicit diphone
boundaries are required.  This is useful within phones such as
diphthongs where the temporal middle need not be the most stable part.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX119"></A>
Another place when specific diphone boundaries are recommended is in the
phone to silence diphones.  The phones at the end of words are typically
longer than word internal phones.  They also tend to trail off in
energy.  Thus the mid-point of a phone immediately before a silence has
typically a much lower energy than the mid point of a word internal
phone.  Thus when a diphone is to be concatenated to a diphone of the
form phone-silence there would be a big jump in energy (as well as other
related spectral characteristics.  Our solution to this is explicitly
label a diphone boundary near the beginning of the phone before the 
silence (about 20% in) where the energy is much closer to what it
will be in the diphone that will precede it.

</P>
<P>
Another point worth noting is that stops at the start of words don't
seem to have a closure part.  However it is a good idea to actually
label one anyway, if you are doing this by hand.  Just "steal"
a suitable short piece of silence from the preceding part of the waveform.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX120"></A>
Because the words will often have very varying amounts of silence
around them it is a good idea to label multiple silences around the word
so that the silence immediately before the first phone is about
200-300 ms and labelling the silence before that as another
phone.  Likewise with the final silence.  Also note as the final
phone before the end silence may trail off it is recommend that
the end of the last phone come at the very end of any signal
thus appear to include silence within it.   Then label the
real silence (200-300 ms) after it.  The reason for this
is if the end silence happens to include some part of the
spoken signal and if duplicated (as is the case with duration
modification) an audible buzz is often introduced.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX121"></A>
<A NAME="IDX122"></A>
Because labelling of diphone nonsense words is such a constrained task
we have included a program for automatically providing a labelling for
the spoken prompts.  This requires that prompts can be generated for the
diphone database.  The aligner uses those prompts to do the aligning.
Though its not actually necessary that the prompts were used as prompts
they do need to be generated for the alignment process.

</P>
<P>
The idea behind the aligner is to take the prompt and the spoken
form and build melcep (and delta melcep) parameterizations
of the files.  Then a DTW algorithm is used to find the best 
alignment between these two sets of parameters.  Then the prompt
label file is used to index through the alignment to give a
label file for the spoken nonsense word.  This is largely based
on the techniques described in <CITE>malfrere97</CITE>.

</P>
<P>
We have tested this aligner on a number of existing hand labelled
database to compare how good its alignment is with respect to
the hand labelling.  We have also tested aligning prompts generated
from a language different from that being recorded.  To do this there
needs to be reasonable mapping between the language phonesets.

</P>
<P>
Here are results for automatically finding labels for
the ked (US English) by aligning them against prompts generated by
three different voices
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>ked itself</EM>
<DD>
mean error 14.77ms stddev 17.08
<DT><EM>mwm (US English)</EM>
<DD>
mean error 27.23ms stddev 28.95
<DT><EM>gsw (UK English)</EM>
<DD>
mean error 25.25ms stddev 23.923
</DL>
<P>
Note that gsw actually gives better results than mwm even though it is a
different dialect of English.  We built three diphone index files from
each of the label sets generated from there alignment processes.
ked-to-ked was the best, and only marginally worse that the database made
from the manually produced labels.  The database from mwm and gsw
produced labels were a little worse but not unacceptably so.
Considering a significant amount of careful corrections were made to the
manually produced labels, these automatically produced labels are still
significantly better than the first pass of hand labels.

</P>
<P>
A further experiment was made across languages.  The ked diphones were
used as prompts to align a set of Korean diphones.  Even though there
are a number of phones in Korean not present in English (various forms
of aspirated consonants) the results are quite usable.

</P>
<P>
Whether you use hand labelling or aligning it is always
worthwhile doing some hand correction after the basic
database is built.   Mistakes (sometimes systematic) always occur
and listening to substantial subset of the diphones (or them
all if you resynthesize the nonsense words) is definitely worth
the time in finding bad diphones.

The script <TT>`festvox/src/diphones/make_labs'</TT>  will process  a set of

<P>
The script is written so it may be use used at once on multiple machines
if you want to parallelize the process.  On a Pentium Pro 200MHz a 2000
word diphone databases can be labelled in about 30 minutes.  Most of
that time is in generating the cepstrum coefficients.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
Once the nonsense words are labelled you need to build a diphone
index.  The index identifies which diphone comes from which files
and where.  This can be automatically built from the label files
(mostly).  The script <TT>`festvox/src/diphones/make_diph_index'</TT> is a 
Festival script that will take the diphone list (as used above) and
find the occurrence of each diphone in the label files and build
an index.  The index consists of a simple header followed by
a line for each diphone.  This consists of diphone name
fileid, start time, mid-point (i.e. the phone boundary) and
end time.  The times are given in <EM>seconds</EM> (note previous
versions of Festival using a different diphone synthesizer module
used milliseconds at this point).

Note the number of entries field must be correct, if it is too small it

This file can be created with a diphone list file and the lab

You should check that this has successfully found all the
named diphones.  When an diphone is not found in a label file and
entry with zeroes for the start middle and end is generated which
will produce a warning when being used in Festival, but it worth while
checking that before hand.

</P>
<P>
The <TT>`make_diph_index'</TT> program will take the mid point between phone
boundaries for the diphone boundary unless otherwise specified (by the
label <CODE>DB</CODE>).  Also it will automatically remove underscores and
dollar symbols from the diphone names before searching for the diphone
in the label file.  It will also only find the first occurrence of the
diphone.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
Festival in its publically distributed form currently only supports
residual excited LPC resynthesis <CITE>hunt89</CITE>.  Festival also supports
PSOLA <CITE>moulines90</CITE> though this is not distributed in the public
version.  Both of these techniques are <EM>pitch synchronous</EM>, that is
there require information about where pitch period occur in the waveform
signal.  Where possible it is better to record a larynograph signal
(electro-glottal graph -- EGG) at the same time as the voice signal.
This signal from a throat microphone records the electrical activity 
in the glottis during speech.

</P>
<P>
Although extracting pitch periods from the LAR signal is not
trivial is it fairly straightforward.  The Edinburgh Speech Tools
provides a program <TT>`pitchmark'</TT> which will process the LAR signal
giving a set of pitchmarks.  However it is not fully automatic and
requires someone to look at the result and make some decisions to
change parameters that may improve the result.  

</P>
<P>
The first major issue in processing the signal is deciding which way up
it is.  From our experience we have seen the signal inverted in some
cases and it is necessary to identify the direction in order for the
rest of the processing to work properly.  In general we've found the
CSTR's LAR output is upside down while OGI's and CMU's output is the
right way up.  Thus if you are using CSTR's recording facilities then
you should add <CODE>-inv</CODE> to the arguments to <TT>`pitchmark'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
The object is produce a single mark at the peak of each
pitch period and "fake" periods during unvoiced regions.  The
basic command we have found that works for us is

<PRE>
pitchmark lar/file001.lar -o pm/file001.pm -otype est \
     -min 0.005 -max 0.012 -fill -def 0.01 -wave_end
</PRE>

<P>
It is worth doing one or two by hand and confirming that a reasonable
pitch period is found.  Note that the <CODE>-min</CODE> and <CODE>-max</CODE>
arguments are speaker depended.  This can be moved towards the fixed F0
point used in the prompts, though remember the speaker will not have
been exactly constant.  The script <TT>`festvox/src/general/make_pm'</TT>
can be copied and modified (for the particular pitch range) and run to
generate the pitchmarks

<PRE>
make_pm lar/*.lar
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
If you don't have an LAR signal for your diphones the alternative is to
extract the pitch periods using some other signal processing function.
Finding the pitch periods is similar to finding the F0 contour and
although hard than finding it from the LAR signal with clean laboratory
speech such as recorded diphones it is possible.  The
following script is a modification of the <TT>`make_pm'</TT> script
above for extracting pitchmarks from a raw waveform signal.  It is not
as good as extracting from the LAR file but is better than nothing
at all.  It is more computationally intensive due to requiring high
order filters.  The value should change depending on the speaker's
pitch range.

As the only publically distributed signal processing method in Festival

Note the (optional) use of <TT>`ch_wave'</TT> to attempt to normalize the
power in the wave to a percentage of its maximum.  This is a very crude
method for making the waveforms have a reasonably equivalent power.
Wildly different power fluctuations in power between segments is likely
to be noticed when they are joined.  Differing power in the nonsense
words may occur if not enough care has been taking in the recording.
Either the settings on the recording equipment have been changed (bad)
or the speaker has changed their vocal effort (worse).  It is important
that this should be avoided as the above normalization does not make the
problem of different power go away it only makes the problem slightly
less bad.

</P>
<P>
A more elaborate power normaliziation has been successful but it is a
little harder, though it was definitely successful for the KED US
American voice that had major power fluctuations over different
recording sesssions.  The idea is to find the power during
vowels in each nonsense word, then find the mean power for each
vowel.  Then for each file find the average factor difference
for each actual vowel with the mean for that vowel.  Scale the
wave for according to that value.  We don't provide
the hacky little shell scripts that do this (because they are hacky).
We generate a set of <TT>`ch_wave'</TT> commands that extract the
parts of the wave from that are vowels (using <TT>`-start'</TT> and
<TT>`-end'</TT> options.  We make the output be in ascii <TT>`-otype raw'</TT>
<TT>`-ostype ascii'</TT> and use a simple awk script to calculate the 
RMS power.  We then calculate the mean power for each vowel with
another awk script using the result as a table, then finally
we process the fileid, actual vowel power information to generate a 
power factor to by averaging the ration of each vowel's
actual power to the mean power for that vowel.  You may
wish to still modify the power further after this if it is
cosidered too low or high.

</P>
<P>
Note power normalization is intended to remove artifacts caused by
different recording environment, i.e. the person moved from the
microphone, the levels were changed etc. they should not modify the
intrinsic power differences in the phones themselves.  The above
techniques try to preserve the intrinsic power, that's why we take the
average over all vowels in a nonsense word, though you should listen to
the results and make the ultimate decision yourself.  

</P>
<P>
If all has been recorded properly now individual power modification
should be necessary.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
Also if you wish to generate a database in a different sample rate from
what was recorded this is the time to resample.  For example
an 8KHz or 11.025KHz will be smaller than a 16KHz database.  If the eventual
voice is to be played over the telephone, for example, there is little
point in generating anything but 8Khz.  Also it will be faster
to synthesize 8Khz utterances than 16Khz ones.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
The number of LPC coefficients used to represent each pitch
period can be changed depending on sample rate you choose.   I have
heard the number should be

<PRE>
(sample_rate/1000)+2
</PRE>

<P>
But that should only be taken as a rough guide though a larger sample
rate deserves a greater number of coeeficients.

<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC30">5.7  Defining a diphone voice</A></H2>

<P>
The easiest way to define a voice is to start from the skeleton scheme
files distributed.  For English voices see section <A HREF="festvox_5.html#SEC33">5.10  US/UK English Walkthrough</A>, and for non-English voices see section <A HREF="festvox_12.html#SEC81">12  Full example</A>.

</P>
<P>
Although in many case you'll want to modify these files (sometimes
quite substantially) the basic skelton files will give yo8u
a good grounding, and they follow some basic conventions of voice
files that will make it easier to integrate your voice into
the Festival system.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC31">5.8  Checking and correcting diphones</A></H2>

<P>
Once you have the basic diphone database working it is worthwhile
systematically testing it as it is common to have mistakes.  These
may be mislabelling, and mispronunciation for the phones themselves.
Two possible strategies are possible for testing both of which have
their advantages.  This first is a simple exhaustive synthesis
of all diphones.  Ideally the diphone prompts are exactly
the set of utterances that test each and every diphone.  using
the <CODE>SayPhones</CODE> function you can synthesize and listen
to each prompt.  Actually for a first pass it may even be useful to
synthesize each nonsense word without listening as some of the problems
missing files, missing diphones, badly extracted pitchmarks
will show up without you having to listen to at all.

</P>
<P>
When a problem occurs trace back why, check the entry in the diphone
index, then check the label for the nonsense word, then check how
that label matches the actually waveform file itself (display the 
waveform with the label file and spectrogram to see if the label
is correct).  

</P>
<P>
Listing all the problems that could occur is impossible, what you need
to do is break down the problem and find out where it might be occurring.
If you just get apparent garbage being synthesized, take a look at the
synthesized waveform

<PRE>
(set! utt1 (SayPhones '(pau hh ah l ow pau)))
(utt.save.wave utt1 "hello.wav")
</PRE>

<P>
Is it <EM>garbage</EM>, can you recognized any part of it?  It
could be a byte swap problem or a format problem for your files.
Can your nonsense word file be played and displayed as is?  Can
your LPC residual files be played and displayed.  Residual files should
look like very low powered waveform files and sound very buzzy when
played but basically recognizable if you know what is being said
(sort of like Kenny from South Park).

</P>
<P>
If you can recognize some of what is being said but it is fairly
uniformly garbled it is possible your pitchmarks are not being aligned
properly.  Use some display mechanism to see where the pitchmarks
are.  These should be aligned (during voiced speech) with the peaks
in the signal.  

</P>
<P>
If all is well except for some parts of the signal are bad or
overflowed, then check the diphone where the errors occur.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
There are a number of solutions to problems that may save you some time,
for the most case they should be considered cheating, but they may save
having to re-record, something that you will probably want to avoid if
at all possible.

</P>
<P>
Note that some phones are very similar, particular the left half
side of most stops are indistinguishable, as the consist of mostly
silence.  Thus if you find you didn't get a good <CODE>&#60;something&#62;-p</CODE>
diphone you can easily make it use the <CODE>&#60;something&#62;-b</CODE> diphone
instead.  You can do this by hand editing the diphone index
file accordingly.

</P>
<P>
The linguists among you may not find that acceptable but you can go
further, the burst part of /p/ and /b/ isn't that different when it
comes down to it and if is it just one or two diphones you can simply
map those too.  Considering problems are often in one or two badly
articulated phones replace a /p/ with a /b/ (or similar) in one or two
diphones may not be that bad.

</P>
<P>
Once however the problems become systematic over a number of
phones re-recording them should be considered.  Though remember if
you do have to re-record you want to have as similar an environment
as possible which is not always easy.  Eventually you may need
to re-record the whole database again.

</P>
<P>
Recording diphone databases is not an exact science, although we have a
fair amount of experience in recording these databases, they never
completely go as planned.  Some apparently minor problem often occurs,
noise on the channel, slightly different power over two sessions.  Even
when everything seems the same and we can't identify any difference
between two recording environments we have found that some voices are
better than others for building diphone databases.  We can't immediately
say why, we discussed some of these issues above in selecting a speaker
but there is still some other parameters which we can't identify so
don't be disheartened when you database isn't as good as you hoped, ours
sometimes fail too.

<P>
The section contains a quick check list of the processes required to
constructing a working diphone database.  Each part is discussed in
detail above.

<UL>
<LI>Choose phoneset:

Find an appropriate phoneset for the language, if possible use an
existing standard.  If you already have a lexicon in the desired
language use that phone set.
<LI>Construct diphone list:

Construct the diphone list with appropriate carrier words.  Either
using an existing list or generating one from the examples.  Consider
what allophones, consonant clusters etc you also wish to record.
<LI>Synthesize prompts:

Synthesize prompts from an existing voice, if possible.  Even when a few
phones are missing from that voice it can still be useful to
have the speaker listen to prompts as it keeps then focussed on
minimal prosody and normalized vocal effort as well as reminding them
what they need to say.
<LI>Record words:

Record the words in the best possible conditions you can.  Bad
recordings can never be corrected later.   Ideally an anechoic chamber
with voice from close talking mike and larynograph channels.
<LI>Hand label/align phones:

If you used prompts you can probably use the provided aligner to
get a reasonable first pass at the phone labels.  Alternatively
find a different aligner or do it by hand.
<LI>Extract pitchmarks:

Extract the pitchmarks from the recorded signal, either from
the LAR signal or by the more complicated approach of extracting
them from the speech signal itself.
<LI>Build parameter files:

If you don't have PSOLA, extract the LPC parameters and residuals
from the speech signal.
<LI>Build database itself:

Build the diphone index, correcting any obvious labelling errors
then test the database itself.  Running significant tests to
correct any further labelling errors.
<LI>Test and check database:

Systematically check the database by synthesizing the prompts
again and synthesizing general text.

<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
<A NAME="IDX139"></A>
When building a new diphone based voice for a supported language, such
as English, the upper parts of the systems can mostly be taken from
existing voices, thus making the building task much more mechanistic.
Of course things can still go wrong and its worth checking everything at
each stage.  This section gives the basic walkthrough for build a new US
English voice.  Support for building UK (southern, RP dialect) is also
provided this way.  For building non-US/UK synthesizers see
section <A HREF="festvox_12.html#SEC81">12  Full example</A> for a similar walkthrough but less language
specific.

</P>
<P>
Recording a whole diphone usually takes a number of hours, <EM>if</EM>
everything goes to plan.  Construction of the voice after recording will
take another couple of hours, though much of this is CPU bound.  Then
hand correction may take another few hours (depending on the quality).
Thus if all goes well it is possible to construct a new voice in a
days work though usually something goes wrong and it takes longer.

</P>
<P>
For those of you who have ignored the rest of this document and are just
hoping to get by by reading this, good luck.  It may be possible to do
that, but considering the time you'll need to invest to build a voice,
being familar with the comments, at least in the rest of this chapter
may be well worth the time invested.

</P>
<P>
The tasks you will need to do are:

<UL>
<LI>construct basic template files

<LI>generate prompts

<LI>record nonsense words

<LI>autolabel nonsense words

<LI>generate diphone index

<LI>generate pitchmarks and LPC coefficients

<LI>Test, and hand fix diphones

<LI>Build diphone group files and distribution

</UL>

<P>
As with all parts of <TT>`festvox'</TT>, you must set the following 
environment variables to where you have installed versions of
the Edinburgh Speech Tools and the festvox distribution

<PRE>
export ESTDIR=/home/awb/projects/1.4.1/speech_tools
export FESTVOXDIR=/home/awb/projects/festvox
</PRE>

<P>
The next stage is to select a directory to build the voice.  You will
need in the order of 500M of diskspace to do this, it could
be done in less, but its better to have enough to start with.  Make a 
new directory and cd into it

<PRE>
mkdir ~/data/cmu_us_awb_diphone
cd ~/data/cmu_us_awb_diphone
</PRE>

<P>
By convention the directory is named for the institution, the language
(<TT>`us'</TT> English) and the speaker (<TT>`awb'</TT>, who actually speaks
with a Scottish accent).  Although it can be fixed later the directory
name is used when festival searches for available voices so it is
good to follow this convention.

Build the basic directory structure

<PRE>
$FESTVOXDIR/src/diphones/setup_diphone cmu us awb
</PRE>

<P>
the arguments to <TT>`setup_diphone'</TT> are, the institution building the
voice, the language, and the name of the speaker.  If you don't have a
institution we recommend you use <TT>`net'</TT>.  There is an ISO standard
for language names, though unfortunately it doesn't allow distinction
between US and UK English, so in general we recommend you use the two
letter form, though for US English use <TT>`us'</TT> and UK English use
<TT>`uk'</TT>.  The speaker name may or may nor be there actually name.

</P>
<P>
The setup script builds the basic directory structure and copies in various
skeleton files.  For languages <TT>`us'</TT> and <TT>`uk'</TT> it copies in
files with much of the details filled in for those languages, for other
languages the skeleton files are much more skeletal.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX143"></A>
For constructing a <TT>`us'</TT> voice you must have the following installed
in your version of festival

<PRE>
festvox_kallpc16k
festlex_POSLEX
festlex_CMU
</PRE>

<P>
And for a UK voice you need

<PRE>
festvox_rablpc16k
festlex_POSLEX
festlex_OALD
</PRE>

<P>
At run-time the two appropriate festlex packages (POSLEX + dialect
specific lexicon) will be required but not the existing kal/rab voices.

</P>
<P>

To generate the nonsense word list 

<PRE>
festival -b bin/diphlist.scm bin/us_schema.scm \
     "(diphone-gen-schema \"awb\" \"etc/awbdiph.list\")"
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX146"></A>
The to synthesize the prompts

<PRE>
festival -b bin/diphlist.scm bin/us_schema.scm \
      "(diphone-gen-waves \"prompt-wav\" \"prompt-lab\" \"etc/awbdiph.list\")"
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX147"></A>
Now record the prompts.  Care should be taken to set up the recording
environment so it is best.  Note all power levels so that if more than
one session is required you can continue and still get the same
recording quality.  Given the lengh tof the US English list its unlikely
a person can say allow of these in one session so ensuring the
environment can be duplicated is important.

<PRE>
bin/prompt_them etc/awbdiph.list
</PRE>

<P>
Note a third argument can be given to state which nonse word to begin
prompting from.  This if you have already recorded the first 100 you
can continue with

<PRE>
bin/prompt_them etc/awbdiph.list 101
</PRE>

<P>
See section <A HREF="festvox_15.html#SEC89">15.1  US phoneset</A> for notes on pronunciation (or
section <A HREF="festvox_15.html#SEC90">15.2  UK phoneset</A> for the UK version).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX148"></A>
The recorded prompts can the be labelled by

<PRE>
bin/make_labs prompt-wav/*.wav
</PRE>

<P>
And the diphone index may be built by

<PRE>
bin/make_diph_index etc/awbdiph.list dic/awbdiph.est
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
If no EGG signal has been collected you can extract the 
pitchmarks by

<PRE>
bin/make_pm_wave wav/*.wav
</PRE>

<P>
Then build the pitchsynchronous LPC coefficients

<PRE>
bin/make_lpc wav/*.wav
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
Now the database is ready for its initial tests.

<PRE>
festival festvox/cmu_us_awb_diphone.scm "(voice_cmu_us_awb_diphone)"
</PRE>

<P>
Test its basic functionality with

<PRE>
festival&#62; (SayPhones '(pau hh ax l ow pau))

festival&#62; (intro)
</PRE>

<P>
As the autolabelling is unlikely to work completely you should 
listen to a number of examples to find out what diphones have
gone wrong.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
Final once you have corrected the errors you can build a final 
voice suitable distribution.  First you need to create a group file
which contains only the subparts of spoken words which contain
the diphones.

<PRE>
festival festvox/cmu_us_awb_diphone.scm "(voice_cmu_us_awb_diphone)"
...
festival (us_make_group_file "group/awblpc.group" nil)
...
</PRE>

<P>
The <CODE>us_</CODE> in the function names stands for <CODE>UniSyn</CODE>
(the unit concatenation subsystem in Festival) and nothing to
do with US English.

</P>
<P>
To test this edit <TT>`festvox/cmu_us_awb_diphone.scm'</TT> and 
change the choice of databases used from separate to grouped.  This is
done by commenting out the line (around line 81)

<PRE>
(set! cmu_us_awb_db_name (us_diphone_init cmu_us_awb_lpc_sep))
</PRE>

<P>
and uncommented the line (around line 84)

<PRE>
(set! cmu_us_awb_db_name (us_diphone_init cmu_us_awb_lpc_group))
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
The next stage is to integrate this new voice so that festival may find it
automatically.  To do this you should add a symbolic link
from the voice directory of Festival's English voices to the
directory containing the new voice.  First cd to
festival's voice directory (this will vary depending on where you
installed festival)

<PRE>
cd /home/awb/projects/1.4.1/festival/lib/voices/english/
</PRE>

<P>
add a symbolic link back to where your voice was built

<PRE>
ln -s /home/awb/data/cmu_us_awb_diphone
</PRE>

<P>
Now this new voice will be available for anyone runing that version festival
(started from any directory)

<PRE>
festival
...
festival&#62; (voice_cmu_us_awb_diphone)
...
festival&#62; (intro)
...
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
The final stage is to generate a distribution file so the voice may
be installed on other's festival installations.  Before you do
this you must add a file <TT>`COPYING'</TT> to the directory you
built the diphone database in.  This should state the terms and conditions
in which people may use, distribute and modify the voice.

</P>
<P>
Generate the distribution tarfile in the directory above the festival
installation (the one where <TT>`festival/'</TT> and <TT>`speech_tools/'</TT>
directory is).

<PRE>
cd /home/awb/projects/1.4.1/
tar zcvf festvox_cmu_us_awb_lpc.tar.gz \
  festival/lib/voices/english/cmu_us_awb_diphone/festvox/*.scm \
  festival/lib/voices/english/cmu_us_awb_diphone/COPYING \
  festival/lib/voices/english/cmu_us_awb_diphone/group/awblpc.group
