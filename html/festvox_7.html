<P>
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
<A NAME="IDX179"></A>
This chapter disucsses and gives examples of building synthesis systems
for limited domains.  By limited domain, we mean domains where the
required synthetic prompting may be infinite but the words and phrases
in it can be enuerated.  Some typical examples are telling the time,
reading telephone numbers.  It possible for this technique to extend to
larger domains such as reading the weather, or even the Darpa
Communcator domain (flight booking dialog system).  

</P>
<P>
Limited domains are dicussed here as it is felt that it should be easier
to build unit selection type synthesizers for domains where there are a
much smaller and controlled number of units.  The second reason is that
general TTS systems (e.g. diphone systems) still sound like a
synthesizer.  General unit selection when its good, offers near human
quality, but when its bad it is usually much worse than a diphone
synthesizer.  Hybrid systems look interesting but as we cannot yet
automatically detect when general unit selection systems go bad, its not
clear when a diphone system should be swapped in.  But as unit selection
offers so much promise, it is hoped that in a limit domain we can get
the unit selection good quality, and avoid the bad quality.  Finally,
although full TTS systems may be our ultimate goal actually for many
existing systems a limit domain synthesizer is adequate.

</P>
<P>
There is a stage beyond limited domain, but falling short of general
opne synthesis, where the most common phrases are the best synthesized
and the quality gracefully degrades as the phrases become less common.
Some hybrid recorded prompts/unit selection/diphone systems have been
proposed and should be able to deliver and answer but we will note deal
directly with those here.

</P>
<P>
However one point you quickly find is that although most speech dialog
systems are very constrained in their vocabulary many require the
hardest class of words: proper names.

</P>
<P>
In continuing in mode of tutorial this chapter first gives a complete
walkthrough of a talking clock.  This is a small example which will
probably work.  Following through this example will give you a good idea
of what is involved in building a limited domain synthesizer.  Also
in the following section problems and modifications can be better 
discussed with respect to this complete example.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC45" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC45">7.1  Telling the time</A></H2>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
Festival includes a very simple little script that speaks the current
time (<TT>`festival/examples/saytime'</TT>).  This section explains how to
replace the synthesizer used from this script with one that talks with
your own voice.  The result may not be perfect but it covers a
significant part of how to build basic synthetic voices and can be
probably done on existing cheap pc recording equipment.

</P>
<P>
Following through this example will give a reasonable understanding
of the relative importance of many important steps in the voice
building process.

</P>
<P>
The following tasks are required:

<UL>
<LI>Designing the prompts

<LI>Recording the prompts

<LI>Autolabelling the prompts

<LI>Building utterance structures for recorded utterances

<LI>Extracting pitchmark and building LPC coefficients

<LI>Building a clunit based synthesizer from the utterances

<LI>Testing and tuning

</UL>

<P>
Before starting set the environment variables FESTVOXDIR and ESTDIR
to the directories which contain the festvox distribution and
the Edinburgh Speech Tools respectively.  Under bash and other
good shells this may be don by commands like

<PRE>
export FESTVOXDIR=/home/awb/projects/festvox
export ESTDIR=/home/awb/projects/1.4.1/speech_tools
</PRE>

<P>
A simple script is provided setting up the basic directory structure
and copying in some default parameter files.  This may or may
not be appropriate for your particular application but it may help.
Make a new directory wher eyou wish your database to be and
change directory to it.  The instructions here are for the saytime
example database.  

<PRE>
mkdir ~/data/time
cd ~/data/time
$FESTVOXDIR/src/ldom/setup_ldom time
</PRE>

<P>
This script makes the directories and copies basic scheme 
files into the <TT>`festvox/'</TT> directory.  You may need to
edit these files later.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC46">7.1.1  Designing the prompts</A></H3>

<P>
In this saytime example the basic format of the utterance is

<PRE>
The time is now, &#60;exactness&#62; &#60;minute info&#62; &#60;hour info&#62;, in the &#60;day info&#62;.
</PRE>

<P>
For example

<PRE>
The time is now, a little after five to ten, in the morning.
</PRE>

<P>
In all there are 1152 (4x12x12x2) utterances (although there are
three possible day info parts (morning, afternoon and evening) they
only get 12 hours, 6 hours and 6 hours repsectively).  Although it
would technically be possible to record all of these we wish to reduce
the amount of recording to a minimum.  Thus what we actually do is 
ensure there is at least one example of each value in each slot.

</P>
<P>
Here is a list of 24 utterances that should cover the main
variations.

<PRE>
The time is now, exactly five past one, in the morning
The time is now, just after ten past two, in the morning
The time is now, a little after quarter past three, in the morning
The time is now, almost twenty past four, in the morning
The time is now, exactly twenty-five past five, in the morning
The time is now, just after half past six, in the morning
The time is now, a little after twenty-five to seven, in the morning
The time is now, almost twenty to eight, in the morning
The time is now, exactly quarter to nine, in the morning
The time is now, just after ten to ten, in the morning
The time is now, a little after five to eleven, in the morning
The time is now, almost twelve.
The time is now, just after five to one, in the afternoon
The time is now, a little after ten to two, in the afternoon
The time is now, exactly quarter to three, in the afternoon
The time is now, almost twenty to four, in the afternoon
The time is now, just after twenty-five to five, in the afternoon
The time is now, a little after half past six, in the evening
The time is now, exactly twenty-five past seven, in the evening
The time is now, almost twenty past eight, in the evening
The time is now, just after quarter past nine, in the evening
The time is now, almost ten past ten, in the evening
The time is now, exactly five past eleven, in the evening
The time is now, a little after quarter to midnight.
</PRE>

<P>
These examples are first put in the prompt file with an utterance
number and the prompt in double quotes like this.

<PRE>
(time0001 "The time is now ...")
(time0002 "The time is now ...")
(time0003 "The time is now ...")
...
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC47">7.1.2  Recording the prompts</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX181"></A>
The best way to record the prompts is to use a professional speaker in a
professional recording studio (anechoic chamber) using dual channel (one
for audio and the other for the electroglottograph signal) direct to a
digital record using a high quality head mounted microphone.

</P>
<P>
However most of us don't have such equipment (or voice talent) so
readily available so what ever you do will probably have to be a
compromise.  The head mounted mic requirement is the cheapest to meet
and it is pretty important so you should at least meet that requirement.
Anechoic chambers are expensive, and even professional recording studios
are easy to access (though most Universities will have some such
facilities).  It is possible to do away with the EGG reading if
a little care is taken to ensure pitchmarks are properly extracted 
from the waveform signal alone.

</P>
<P>
We have been successful in recording with a standard PC using a standard
soundblaster type 16bit audio card though results do vary from machine
to machine.  Before attempting this you shoudl record a few examples on
the PC to see how much noise is being picked up by the mic.  For example
try the following

<PRE>
$ESTDIR/bin/na_record -f 16000 -time 5 -o test.wav -otype riff
</PRE>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
This will record 5 seconds from the microphone in the machien you run
the command on.  You should also do this to test that the microphone
is plugged in (and switched on).  Play back the recorded wave with
<TT>`na_play'</TT> and perhaps play with the mixer levels until you get
the least background noise with the strongest spoken signal.  Now
you should display the waveform to see (as well as hear) how much
noise is there.

<PRE>
$FESTVOXDIR/src/general/display_sg test.wav
</PRE>

<P>
This will display the waveform and its spectrogram.  Noise will show up
in the silence (and other) parts.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
There a few ways to reduce noise.  Ensure the microphone cable isn't
wrapped around other cables (especially power cables).  Turning the
computer 90 degrees may help and repositioning things can help too.
Moving the sound board to some other slot in the machine can also help
as well as getting a different microphone (even the same make).

</P>
<P>
There is a large advantage in recording straight to disk as it allows
the recording to go directly into right files.  Doing off-line recording
(onto DAT) is better in reducing noise but transfering it to disk and
segmenting it is a long a tedious process.

</P>
<P>
First generate the prompts with the command

<PRE>
festival -b etc/ldom.scm "(build_prompts \"etc/time.data\")"
</PRE>

<P>
and prompt and record them with the command

<PRE>
bin/prompt_them etc/time.data
</PRE>

<P>
You may or may not find listening to the prompts before speaking
useful.  Simply displaying them may be adequate for you (if so 
comment out the <TT>`na_play'</TT> line in <TT>`bin/prompt_ldom'</TT>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC48">7.1.3  Autolabelling the prompts</A></H3>

<P>
The recorded prompt can be labelled by aligning them against
the synthesize prompts.  This is done by the command

<PRE>
bin/make_labs prompt-wav/*.wav
</PRE>

<P>
If the utterances are long (&#62; 10 seconds of speech) you may require lots
of swap space to do this stage (this could be fixed).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
Once labelled you should check that they are labelled
reasonable.  The labeller typically gets it pretty much correct,
or very wrong, so a quick check can often save time later.  You 
can check the database using the command

<PRE>
emulabel etc/emu_lab
</PRE>

<P>
Once you are happy with the labelling you can construct the
whole utterance structure for the spoken utterances.  This is done
by combining the basic structure from the synthesized prompts and
the actualy times from the automatifcally labelled ones.  This
can be done with the command

<PRE>
festival -b etc/ldom.scm "(build_utts \"etc/time.data\")"
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC49">7.1.4  Extracting pitchmark and building LPC coefficients</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
If you have recorded EGG signals the you can use <TT>`bin/make_pm'</TT>
from the <TT>`.lar'</TT> files.  Note that you may need to add (or remove)
the optin <TT>`-inv'</TT> depending on the updownness of your EGG signal.
However so far only the CSTR larygnograph seems to produce inverted
signals so the default should be adequate.  Also not the
parameters that specify the pitch period range, <TT>`-min'</TT> and <TT>`max'</TT>
the defaul setting are suitable for a male speaker, for a feamle you
should modify these to something like

<PRE>
-min 0.0033 -max 0.0875 -def 0.005
</PRE>

<P>
The changing from a range of (male) 200Hz-80Hz with a default of
100Hz, to a female range of 300Hz-120Hz and default of 200Hz.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
If you don't have an EGG signal you must extract the pitch from the
waveform itself.  This works though may require a little modification of
parameters, and it is computationally more expensive (and wont be as
exact as from an EGG signal).  There are two methods, one
using Entropic's <TT>`epoch'</TT> program which work pretty well
without tuning parameters.  The second is to use the free Speech
Tools program <TT>`pitchmark'</TT>.  The first is very computationally
expensive, and as Entropic is no longer in existence, the program
is no longer available (though rumours circulate that it may
appear again for free).  To use <TT>`epoch'</TT> use the program

<PRE>
bin/make_pm_epoch wav/*.wav
</PRE>

<P>
To use <TT>`pitchmark'</TT> use the command

<PRE>
bin/make_pm_wave wav/*.wav
</PRE>

<P>
As with the EGG extraction <TT>`pitchmark'</TT> uses parameters to specify
the range of the pitch periods, you should modify the parameters to best
match your speakers range.  The other filter parameters also 
can make a different to the success.   Rather than try to explain
what changing the figures mean (I admit I don't fully know), the
best solution is to explain what you need to obtain as a result.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
You can view the derived pitchmarks once they are converted to more
standard label files using the command

<PRE>
bin/make_pm_lab pm/*.pm
</PRE>

<P>
Then view them with

<PRE>
emulabel etc/emu_pm
</PRE>

<P>
Zoom into a voiced part of the speech, the pm labels should be alligned
to the largest peaks in the signal.  (** this needs much more
explanation, and a pointer to some correct/incorrect pictures **)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
At this point you may find that your waveform file is upside down.
Normally this wouldn't matter but due to the basic signal processing
techniques qe used to find the pitch periods upside down signals confuse
things.  People tell me that it shouldn't happen but some recording
devices return an inverted signal.  From the cases we've seen the same
device always returns the same form so if one of your recordings is
upside down all of them probably are (though there are some published
speech databases e.g. BU Radio data, where a random half are upside
down).  

</P>
<P>
In general the higher peaks should be positive rather than negative.
If not you can invert the signals with the command

<PRE>
for i in wav/*.wav
do
   ch_wave -scale -1.0 $i -o $i
done
</PRE>

<P>
If they are upside, invert them and re-run the pitch marking.  (If
you do invert them it is not necessary to re-run the segment labelling.)

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
Once you have pitchmarks, next you need to generate the pitch
synchronous MELCEP parameterization of the speech used in building the
cluster synthesizer.

<PRE>
bin/make_mcep wav/*.wav
</PRE>



<H3><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC50">7.1.5  Building a clunit based synthesizer from the utterances</A></H3>

<P>
Building a full clunit synthesizer is probably a little bit of over kill
but the technique basically works.  See section <A HREF="festvox_6.html#SEC34">6  Unit selection databases</A>
for a more detailed discussion of this technique.  The basic
parameter file <TT>`festvox/time_params.scm'</TT>, is reasonable as
a start.

<PRE>
festival -b festvox/time_build.scm "(do_all)"
</PRE>

<P>
If all goes well this should create a file
<TT>`festival/clunits/time.catalogue'</TT> and set of index trees in
<TT>`festival/trees/time.tree'</TT>.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC51">7.1.6  Testing and tuning</A></H3>

<P>
To test the new voice start Festival as

<PRE>
festival festvox/time_ldom.scm "(voice_time_ldom)"
</PRE>

<P>
The function <TT>`(saytime)'</TT> can now be called and it should
say the current time.

</P>
<P>
Note this synthesizer can <EM>only</EM> say the phrases that it has phones
for which basically means it can only say the time in the format given
at the start of this chapter.  Thus although you can
use <TT>`SayText'</TT> you can only five it text in the write form
if you expect it to works.  That's what limited domain synthesis
is.

</P>
<P>
A full directory structure of this example with the recordings and
parameters files is available at <A HREF="http://www.festvox.org/examples/cmu_time_awb_ldom/">http://www.festvox.org/examples/cmu_time_awb_ldom/</A>.  And an on-line demo of this voice in that directory is
available at <A HREF="http://www.festvox.org/ldomdemos.html">http://www.festvox.org/ldomdemos.html</A>.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC52">7.2  Making it better</A></H2>

<P>
The above walkthough is to give you a basic idea of stages involved in
building a limited domain synthesizer.  The quality of a limited domain
synthesizer will most likely be execellent in parts and very bad in
others which is typical of techniques like this.  Each stage is, of
course, more complex than this and there are a number of things that can
be done to improve it.

</P>
<P>
For limited domain synthesize it should be possible to correct 
the errors such that it is execellent always.  To do so though requires
being able to diagnose where the problems are.  The most
likely problems are listed here

<UL>
<LI>Mis-labelling

Due to lipsmacks, and other reasons the labelling may not be correct.
The result maye the wrong, extra or missing segments in the synthesized
utterance.  Using <TT>`emulabel'</TT> you can check and hand correct the
labels.
<LI>Mis-spoken data

The speaker may have made a mistake in the content.  This can often
happen even when the speaker is careful.  Mistakes can be actual
content (it is easy to read a list of number wrongly), but also
hesitations and false starts can make the recording bad.  Also note
that inconsistent prosodic variation can also affect the synthesis
quality.   Re-recording can be considered for bad examples,
or you can delete them from the <TT>`etc/LDOM.data'</TT> list, assuming
there is enough variation in the rest of the examples to ensure
proper coverage of the domain.
<LI>Bad pitchmarking

Automatic pitchmarking is not really automatic.  It is very worthwhile
checking to see if it is correct and re-runing the pitchmarking with
better paremeters until it is better.  (We need better documentation
here on how to know what "correct" is.)
<LI>Looking at the data

There is never a substitute for actually looking at the data.  Use
<TT>`emulabel'</TT> to actually look at the recorded utterances and see what
the labelling is.  Ensure these match and files haven't got out of
order.  Look at a random selection not just the first example.
<LI>Improving the unit clustering

The clustering techniques and the features used here are pretty generic
and by no means optimal.  Even for the simple example given here it is
not very good.  See the chapter on section <A HREF="festvox_6.html#SEC34">6  Unit selection databases</A> for
more discussion on this.  Adding new features for use in cluster may
help a lot.
</UL>

<P>
The line between limit domain synthesis and unit selection is fuzzy.
The more complex and varied the phrases you synthesize are, the more
difficult it is to produce reliable synthesis.
