<H1><A NAME="SEC69" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC69">10  Text analysis</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter discusses some of the basic problems in analyzing text when
trying to convert it to speech.  To be of practical use it is necessary
to do at least some level text analysis in a new language.  Almost any
piece of real text will contain tokens that do not have a simple one to
one pronunciation.  In Festival our view is that the initial text is
tokenized into white space separated items.  (See discussion below about
how you might do languages that don't normally separate tokens by white
space.)  These tokens can then be mapped to words through simple rules
(or statistically trained models) allowing for one token to map to zero
or more words, and also allow that mapping to be context sensitive.

</P>
<P>
Numbers are probably the most common form of token that doesn't
have a simple lookup pronunciation, there is no way you can
list all strings of digits in a lexicon so some analysis into
words is the most reasonable way of dealing with them.  This
is dicussed below.  Also in many languages strings of digits
may sometimes be pronounced as numbers (ordinals or cardinals) 
or as strings of digits (e.g. telephone numbers) or in some
case have their own special pronunciation in certain
contexts (e.g. years in English).  We will discuss some
examples below.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC70" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC70">10.1  Token to word rules</A></H2>

<P>
The basic model in Festival is that each <EM>token</EM> will be mapped a
list of <EM>words</EM> by a call to a <CODE>token_to_word</CODE> function.  This
function will be called on each token and it should return a list of
words.  It may check the tokens to context (within the current
utterance) too if necessary.  The default action should (for most
languages) simply be returning the token itself as a list of own word
(itself).  For example your basic function should look something like.

<PRE>
(define (MYLANG_token_to_words token name)
  "(MYLANG_token_to_words TOKEN NAME)
Returns a list of words for the NAME from TOKEN.  This primarily
allows the treatment of numbers, money etc."
  (cond
   (t
    (list name))))
</PRE>

<P>
This function should be set in your voice selection function 
as the function for token analysis

<PRE>
  (set! token_to_words MYLANG_token_to_words)
</PRE>

<P>
This function should be added to to deal with
all tokens that are not in your lexicon, cannot be
treated by your letter to sound rules, or are ambiguous
in some way and require context to resolve.

</P>
<P>
For example suppose we wish to simply treat all tokens consisting of
strings of digits to be pronounced as a string of digits (rather
than numbers).  We would add something like the following

<PRE>
(set! MYLANG_digit_names
   '((0 "zero")
     (1 "one")
     (2 "two")
     (3 "three")
     (4 "four")
     (5 "five")
     (6 "six")
     (7 "seven")
     (8 "eight")
     (9 "nine")))

(define (MYLANG_token_to_words token name)
  "(MYLANG_token_to_words TOKEN NAME)
Returns a list of words for the NAME from TOKEN.  This primarily
allows the treatment of numbers, money etc."
  (cond
   ((string-matches name "[0-9]+") ;; any string of digits
    (mapcar
     (lambda (d)
      (car (cdr (assoc_string d MTLANG_digit_names))))
     (symbolexplode name)))
   (t
    (list name))))
</PRE>

<P>
But more elaborate rules are also necessary.  Some tokens require context
to disambiguate and sometimes multiple tokens are really one object e.g
<SAMP>`$12 billion'</SAMP> must be rendered as <SAMP>`twelve billion dollars'</SAMP>,
where the money name crosses over the second word.  Such multi-token rules
must be split into multiple conditions, one for each part of the
combined token.  Thus we need to identify the <SAMP>`$&#60;digits&#62;'</SAMP> is in a
context followed by <SAMP>`?illion'</SAMP>.  The code below renders the full
phrase for the dollar amount.  The second condition ensures nothing
is returned for the <SAMP>`?illion'</SAMP> word as it has already been dealt with
by the previous token.

<PRE>
   ((and (string-matches name "\\$[123456789]+")
         (string-matches (item.feat token "n.name") ".*illion.?"))
     (append
      (digits_to_cardinal (string-after name "$")) ;; amount
      (list (item.feat token "n.name"))            ;; magnitude
      (list "dollars")))                           ;; currency name
   ((and (string-matches name ".*illion.?")
         (string-matches (item.feat token "p.name") "\\$[123456789]+"))
     ;; dealt with in previous token
     nil)
</PRE>

<P>
Note this still is not enough as there may be other types of currency
pounds, yen, francs etc, some of which may be mass nouns and require no
plural (e.g. <SAMP>`yen'</SAMP>) and some of which make be count nouns require
plurals.  Also this only deals with whole numbers of .*illions,
<SAMP>`$1.25 million'</SAMP> is common too.  See the full example (for English)
in <TT>`festival/lib/token.scm'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
A large list of rules are typically required.  They should be looked
upon as breaking down the problem into smaller parts, potentially
recursive.  For example hyphenated tokens can be split into two words.
It is probably wise to explicitly deal with all tokens than are not
purely alphabetic.  Maybe having a catch-all that spells out all tokens
that are not explicitly dealt with (e.g. the numbers).  For
example you could add the following as the penumtilmate condition
in your <CODE>token_to_words</CODE> function

<PRE>
   ((not (string-matches name "[A-Za-z]"))
    (symbolexplode name))
</PRE>

<P>
Note this isn't necessary correct when certain letters may be homograpths.
For example the token <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> may be a determiner or a letter
of the alhpabet.  When its a derterminer it may (often) be reduced)
while as a letter it probably ins't (i.e pronunciation in <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> 
or <SAMP>`ei'</SAMP>).  Other languages also example this problem (e.g. Spanish
<SAMP>`y'</SAMP>.  Therefore when we call symbol explode we don't want just the 
the letter but to also specify that it is the letter pronunciation we
want and not the any other form.  To ensure the lexicon system
gets the right pronunciation we there wish to specify the part
fo speech with the letter.  Actually rather than just a string
of atomic words being returned by the <CODE>token_to_words</CODE> function
the words may be descriptions including features.  Thus for example
we dont just want to return 

<PRE>
(a b c)
</PRE>

<P>
We want to be more specific and return

<PRE>
(((name a) (pos nn))
 ((name b) (pos nn))
 ((name c) (pos nn)))
</PRE>

<P>
This can be done by the code

<PRE>
   ((not (string-matches name "[A-Za-z]"))
    (mapcar
     (lambda (l)
      ((list 'name l) (list 'pos 'nn)))
     (symbolexplode name)))
</PRE>

<P>
The above assumes that all single characters symbols (letters, digits,
punctuation and other "funny" characters have an entry in your lexicon
with a part of speech field <CODE>nn</CODE>, with a pronunctiation of the
character in isolation.

</P>
<P>
The list of tokens that you may wish to write/train rules for 
is of couse language dependent and to a certain extent domain
dependent.  For example there are many more numbers in email text
that in narative novels.  The number of abbreviations is also much
higher in email and news stories than in more normal text.  It may
be worth having a look at some typical data to find out the distribution
and find out what is worth working on.   For a rough guide the folowing
is a list if the symbol types we currentl deal with in English, many
of which will require some treatment in other languages.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><EM>Money</EM>
<DD>
Money amounts often have different treatment than simple numbers
and conventions about the sub-currency part (i.e. cents, pfennings etc).
Remember that you its not just numbers in the local currency you
have to deal with currency values from different countries are common
in lots of different texts (e.g dollars, yen, DMs and euro).
<DT><EM>Numbers</EM>
<DD>
strings of digits will of course need mapping even if there is only one
mapping for a language (rare).  Consider at least telphone numbers
verses amounts, most languages make a distinction here.   In English
we need to distinguish further, see below for the more detailed
discussion.
<DT><EM>number/number</EM>
<DD>
This can be used as a date, fraction, alternate, context  will help,
though techniques of dropping back to saying the the string of characters
often preserve the ambiguity which can be better that forcing
a decision.
<DT><EM>acronyms</EM>
<DD>
List of upper case letters (with or without vowels).  The decision
to pronounce as a word or as letters is difficult in general but
good guesses go far.  If its short (&#60; 4 chatacters) not in your
lexicon not surround by other words in upper case, its probably
an acronym, further analyss of vowels, consonant clusters
etc will help.
<DT><EM>number-number</EM>
<DD>
Could be a range, of score (football), dates etc.
<DT><EM>word-word</EM>
<DD>
Usually a simple split on each part is sufficient--but not as when used
as a dash.
<DT><EM>word/word</EM>
<DD>
As an alternative, or a Unix pathname
<DT><EM>'s or TOKENs</EM>
<DD>
An appended <SAMP>`s'</SAMP> to a non alphabetic token is probabaly
some form of pluralization, removing it and recursing on the analysis
is a reasonable thing to try.
<DT><EM>times and dates</EM>
<DD>
These exist is variaous stnadardized forms many of which are easy
to recognize and break down.
<DT><EM>telephone numbers</EM>
<DD>
This various from country to country (and by various conventions)
but there may be standard forms that can be recognized.
<DT><EM>romain numerals</EM>
<DD>
Sometimes these are pronounced as numbers <SAMP>`chapter II'</SAMP>, or
as cardinals <SAMP>`James II'</SAMP>.
<DT><EM>ascii art</EM>
<DD>
If you are dealing with on line text there are often extra characters
in a document that should be ignored, or at least not pronounced
literally, e.g. lines of hyphens used as separators.
<DT><EM>email addresses, URLs, file names</EM>
<DD>
Depending on your context this may be worth spending time on.
<DT><EM>tokens containing any other non-alphanumeric character</EM>
<DD>
Spliting the token around the non-alphanumeric and recursing 
on each part before and after it may be reasonable.
</DL>
<P>
Remember the first purpose of text analysis is ensure you
can deal with <EM>anything</EM>, even if it is just saying
the word <SAMP>`unknown'</SAMP> (in the appropriate language).  Also its
probabaly not worth spending time on rare token forms, though remember
it not easy to judge what are rare and what are not.

<H2><A NAME="SEC71" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC71">10.2  Number pronunciation</A></H2>

<P>
Almost every one will expect a synthesizer to be able to
speech numbers.  As it is not feasible to list all possible
digit strings in your lexicon.  You will need to provide a function
that returns a string of words for a given string of digits.

</P>
<P>
In its simplest form you should provide a function that 
decodes the string of digits.  The example <CODE>spanish_number</CODE>
(and <CODE>spanish_number_from_digits</CODE>) in the released Spanish
voice (<TT>`festvox_ellpc11k.tar.gz'</TT> is a good general
example.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC72">10.2.1  Multi-token numbers</A></H3>

<P>
A number of languages uses spaces within numbers where English might use
commas.  For example German, Polish and others text may contain

<PRE>
64 000 
</PRE>

<P>
to denote sixty four thousand.  As this will be multiple tokens in
Festival's basic analysis it is necessary to write multiple conditions
in your <CODE>token_to_words</CODE> function.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC73" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC73">10.2.2  Declensions</A></H3>

<P>
In many languages, the pronunciation of a number depends on the thing
that is being counted.  For example the digit '1' in Spanish has
multiple pronunciations depending on whether it is refering to a
masculine or feminine object.  In some languages this becomes much more
complex where there are a number of possible declensions.  In our Polish
synthesizer we solved this by adding an extra argument to number
generation function which then selected the actual number word
(typically the final word in a number) based in the desired declension.
