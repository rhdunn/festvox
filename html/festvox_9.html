<H1><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC52">9  Unit selection databases</A></H1>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX156"></A>
This chapter discussed some of the options for building waveform
synthesizers using unit selection techniques in Festival.  This is still
very much an on-going research question and we are still adding new
techniques as well as improving existing ones often so the techniques
described here are not as mature as the techniques as described in
previous diphone chapter.

</P>
<P>
By "unit selection" we actually mean the selection of some unit of
speech which may be anything from whole phrase down to diphone (or even
smaller).  Technically diphone selection is a simple case of this.
However typically what we mean is unlike diphone selection, in unit
selection there is more than one example of the unit and some mechanism
is used to select between them at run-time.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX157"></A>
<A NAME="IDX158"></A>
ATR's CHATR <CITE>hunt96</CITE> system and earlier work at that lab
<CITE>nuutalk92</CITE> is an excellent example of one particular method for
selecting between mutiple examples of a phone within a database.  For a
discussion of why a more generalized inventory of units is desired see
<CITE>campbell96</CITE> though we will reiterate some of the points here.
With diphones a fixed view of the possible space of speech units has
been made which we all know is not ideal.  There are articulatory
effects which go over more than one phone, e.g. /s/ can take on
artifacts of the roundness of the following vowel even over an
itermediate stop, e.g. <SAMP>`spout'</SAMP> vs <SAMP>`spit'</SAMP>.  But its not just
obvious segmental effects that cause variation in pronunciation,
syllable position, word/phrase initial and final position have typically
a different level of articulation from segments taken from word internal
position.  Stressing and accents also cause differences.  Rather than
try to explicitly list the desired inventory of all these phenomena and
then have to record all of them a potential alternative is to take a
natural distribution of speech and (semi-)automatifcally find the
distinctions that actually exist rather predefining them.

</P>
<P>
The theory is obvious but the design of such systems and finding the
approrpiate selection criteria, weighting the costs of relative candidates
is a non-trivial problem.  However tecniques like this often produce
very high quality, very natural sounding synthesis.  However they also
can produce some very bad synthesis too, when the database has unexpected
holes and/or the selection costs fail.

</P>
<P>
Two forms of unit selection will discussed here, not because we feel
they are the best but simply because they are the ones actually
implemented by us and hence can be distributed.  These should still be
considered research systems.  Unless you are specifically interested or
have the expertise in developing new selection techniques it is not
recommended that you try these, if you need a working voice within a
month and can't afford to miss that deadline then the diphone option is
safe, well tried and stable.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC53">9.1  Cluster unit selection</A></H2>

<P>
This is a reimplementation of the techniques as described in
<CITE>black97c</CITE>.  The idea is to take a database of general speech and
try to cluster each phone type into groups of acoustically similar units
based on the (non-acoustic) information available at synthesis time,
such as phonetic context, prosodic features (F0 and duration) and higher
level features such as stressing, word position, and accents.  The
actually features used may easily be changed an experimented with as can
the definition of the definition of acoustic distance between the units
in a cluster.  

</P>
<P>
In some sense this work builds on the results of both the CHATR
selection algorithm <CITE>hunt96</CITE> and the work of <CITE>donovan95</CITE>, but
differs in some important and significant ways.  Specifically in
contrast to <CITE>hunt96</CITE> this cluster algorithm pre-builds CART trees
to select the approriate cluster of candidate phones thus avoiding the
computationally expensive function of calculating target costs (through
linear regression) at selection time.  Secondly because the clusters are
built directly from the acoustic scores and target features, a target
estimation function isn't required removing the need to calculate
weights for each feature.  This cluster method differs from the
clustering method in <CITE>donovan95</CITE> in that it can use more
generalized features in clustering and uses a different acoustic cost
function (Donovan uses HMMs), also his work is based on sub-phonetic
units (HMM states).  Also Donovan selects one candidate while here we
select a group of candidates and finds the best overall selection by
finding the best path through each set of candidates for each target
phone, in a manner similar to <CITE>hunt96</CITE> and <CITE>iwahashi93</CITE>
before.

</P>
<P>
The basic processes involved in building a waveform synthesizer for
the clustering algorithm are as follows.

<UL>
<LI>

Collect the database of general speech.
<LI>

Build utterance structures for your database using the techniques
discussed in section <A HREF="festvox_7.html#SEC38">7.4  Utterance building</A>
<LI>

Building coefficients for acostic distances, typically some
form of cepstrum plus F0, or some pitch synchronous analysis (e.g.
LPC).
<LI>

Build distances tables, precalculating the acoustic distance
between each unit of the same phone type.
<LI>

Dump selection features (phone context, prosodic, positional and
whatever) for each unit type.
<LI>

Build cluster trees using <TT>`wagon'</TT> with the features and acoustic
distances dumped by the previous two stages
<LI>

Building the voice description itself
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="SEC54" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC54">9.1.1  Collecting databases for unit selection</A></H3>

<P>
Unlike diphone database which are carefully constructed to ensure
specific coverage one of the advantages of unit selection is that
a much more general database is desired.  However, although voices
may be built from existing data not specifically gathered for
synthesis there are still factors about the data that will help make
better synthesis.

</P>
<P>
Like diphone databases the more cleanly and carefully the speech is
recorded the better the synthesized voice will be.  As we are going to
be selecting units from different parts of the database the more similar
the recordings are, the less likely bad joins will occur.  However
unlike diphones database prosodic variation is probably a good thing, as
it is those variations that can make synthesis from unit selection sound
more natural.  Good phonetic coverage is also useful, at least phone
coverage if not complete diphone coverage.  Also synthesis using these
techniques seem to retain aspects of the original database.  If the
database is broadcast news stories, the synthesis from it will typically
sound like read news stories (or more importantly will sound best when
it is reading news stories).

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX159"></A>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
Although it is too early to make definitive statements about what size
and type of data is best for unit selection we do have some rough
guides.  A Timit like database of 460 phonetically balanced sentences
(around 14,000 phones) is not an unreasonable first choice.  If the
text has not been specifically selected for phonetic coverage a larger
database is probably required, for example the Boston Univeristy Radio
News Corpus speaker <CODE>f2b</CODE> <CITE>ostendorf95</CITE> has been used
relatively successfully.  Of course all this depends on what use you
wish to make of the synthesizer, if its to be used in more restrictive
environments (as is often the case) tailoring the database for the task
is a very good idea.  If you are going to be reading a lot of telephone
numbers, having a significant number of examples of read numbers will
make synthesis of numbers sound much better.

</P>
<P>
The database used as an example here is a TIMIT 460 sentence database
read by an American male speaker.

</P>
<P>
Again the notes about recording the database apply, though it will
sometimes be the case that the database is already recorded and beyond
your control, in that case you will always have something legitimate to
blame for poor quality synthesis.

</P>

<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
Throughout our dicussion we will assume the following database layout.
It is highly recommended that you follow this format otherwise scripts,
and examples will fail.  There are many ways to organize databases and
many of such choices are arbitrary, here is our "arbitrary" layout.

</P>
<P>
The basic database directory should contain the following directories
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>bin/</CODE>
<DD>
Any database specific scripts for processing.  Typically this
first contains a copy of standard scripts that are then customized
when necessary to the particulary database
<DT><CODE>wav/</CODE>
<DD>
The waveform files.  These should be headered, one utterances per file
with a standard name convention.  They should have the extention
<TT>`.wav'</TT> and the fileid consistent with all other files through
the database (labels, utterances, pitch marks etc).
<DT><CODE>lab/</CODE>
<DD>
The segmental labels.  This is usually the master label files,
these may contain more information that the labels used by festival
which will be in <TT>`festival/relations/Segment/'</TT>.
<DT><CODE>wrd/</CODE>
<DD>
Word label files.
<DT><CODE>lar/</CODE>
<DD>
The EGG files (larynograph files) if collected.
<DT><CODE>pm/</CODE>
<DD>
Pitchmark files as generated from the lar files or from the signal
directly.
<DT><CODE>festival/</CODE>
<DD>
Festival specific label files.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><TT>`festival/relations/'</TT>
<DD>
The processed labelled files for building Festival utterances,
held in directories whose name reflects the relation they represent:
<TT>`Segment/'</TT>, <TT>`Word/'</TT>, <TT>`Syllable/'</TT> etc.
<DT><TT>`festival/utts/'</TT>
<DD>
The utterances files as generated from the <TT>`festival/relations/'</TT>
label files.
</DL>
</DL>
<P>
Other directories will be created for various processing reasons.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC56">9.1.3  Building utterance structures for unit selection</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX163"></A>
In order to make access well defined you need to construct Festival
utterance structures for each of the utterances in your database.  This
(in is basic form) requires labels for: segments, syllables, words,
phrases, F0 Targets, and intonation events.  Ideally these should all be
carefully hand labelled but in most cases that's impractical.  There are
ways to automatically obtain most of these labels but you should be
aware of the inherit errors in the labelling system you use (including
labelling systems that involve human labellers).  Note that when a unit
selection method is to be used that fundamentally uses segment
boundaries its quality is going to be ultimately determined by the
quality of the segmental labels in the databases.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
For the unit selection algorithm described below the segemntal labels
should be using the same phoneset as used in the actual synthesis voice.
However a more detailed phonetic labelling may be more useful
(e.g. marking closures in stops) mapping that information back to the
phone labels before actual use.  Autoaligned databases typically aren't
acurate enough for use in unit selection.  Most autoaligners are built
using speech recognition technology where actual phone boundaries are
not the primary measure of success.  General speech recognition systems
primarily measure words correct (or more usefully semantically correct)
and do not require phone boundaries to be acurate.  If the database is
to be used for unit selection it is very important that the phone
boundaries are accurate.  Having said this though, we have successfully
used the aligner described in the diphone chpater above to label general
utterance where we knew which phone string we were looking for, using
such an aligner may be a useful first pass, but the result should always
be checked by hand.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>
It has been suggested that aligning techniques and unit selection
training techniques can be used to judge the accuracy of the labels and
basically exclude any segments that appear to fall outside the typical
range for the segment type.  Thus it, is believed that unit selection
algorithms should be able to deal with a certain amount of noise in the
labelling.  This is the desire for researchers in the field, but we
are some way from that and the easiest way at present to improve the
quality of unit selection algorithms at present is to ensure that
segmental labelling is as accurate as possible.  Once we have a better
handle on selection techniques themselves it will then be possible to
start experimenting with noisy labelling.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
However it should be added that this unit selection technique (and many
others) support what is termed "optimal coupling" (<CITE>conkie96</CITE>)
where the acoustically most appropriate join point is found
automatically at run time when two units are selected for concatenation.
This technique is inherently robust to at least a few tens of
millisecond boundary labelling errors.

</P>
<P>
For the cluster method defined here it is best to construct more than 
simply segments, durations and an F0 target.  A whole syllabic structure
plus word boundaries, intonation events and phrasing allow a much richer
set of features to be used for clusters.  See section <A HREF="festvox_7.html#SEC38">7.4  Utterance building</A>
for a more general discussion of how to build utterance structures
for a database.

<H3><A NAME="SEC57" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC57">9.1.4  Making cepstrum parameter files</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
In order to cluster similar units in a database we build an
acoustic representation of them.  This is is also still a research
issue but in the example here we will use Mel cepsrtum plus
delta Mel cepstrum plus F0.  Though this is open for change (and
can easily be done so).

</P>
<P>
Here is an example script which will generate these parameters for a
database, it is included in <TT>`festvox/src/unitsel/make_mcep'</TT> The
main loop here generates the cepstrum parameters and the F0 and then
combinsthem into a single file with F0 as parameter 0.  This format is
assumed for the later acoustic measures though the number
of cepstrum/delta cepstrum parameters may be changed if
desired.

The above builds coefficients at fixed frames.  We have also
experiemented with building parameters pitch synchornously and have
found a slight improvement in the usefulness of teh emasure based on
this.  We do not pretend that this part is particularly neat in the
system but it does work.  When pitch synchornous parameters are
build the cluints module will automatically put the local
F0 value in coefficient 0 at load time.  This happens to be
appropriate from LPC coefficients.  The script in
<TT>`festvox/src/general/make_lpc'</TT> can be used to
generate the parameters, assuming you have already 
generated pitch marks.

</P>
<P>
Note the secondary advantage of using LPC coefficients is that they are
requied any way for LPC resynthesis thus this allows less information
about the database to be required at run time.  We have not yet tried
pitch synchronous MEL frequency cepstrum coefficients but that should be
tried.  Also a more general duration/number of pitch periods match
algorithm is worth defining.

Cluster building is mostly automatic.  Of course you need the
<CODE>clunits</CODE> modules compiled into your version of Festival.  Version
1.3.1 or later is required, the version of <CODE>clunits</CODE> in 1.3.0 is
buggy and incomplete and will not work.  To compile in <CODE>clunits</CODE>,
add

<PRE>
ALSO_INCLUDE += clunits
</PRE>

<P>
to the end of your <TT>`festival/config/config'</TT> file, nad recompile.
To chaeck if an installation already has support for <CODE>clunits</CODE>
check the value of the variable <CODE>*modules*</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
The file <TT>`festival/src/modules/clunits/acost.scm'</TT> contains the
basic code to build a cluster model for a databases that has utterance
structures and acoustic parameters.  The function <CODE>do_all</CODE>
will build the distance tables, dump the features and build
the cluster trees.  The many parameters are set for the particular database 
(and instance of cluster building) through the Lisp variable
<CODE>clunits_params</CODE>.  An example is given in 
<TT>`festival/src/modules/clunits/ked_params.scm'</TT> for the KED timit
database.

</P>
<P>
The function <CODE>do_all</CODE> runs through all the steps but as some
the steps are relatively time consuming there may be times when
each of the steps needs to be run individually.  We will go through
each step and at that time explain which parameters affect the
substep.

</P>
<P>
Ther first stage is to load in all the utterances in the
database, sort them into segment type and name them with individual
names (as <CODE>&#60;type&#62;_&#60;num&#62;</CODE>).  This first stage is
required for all other stages so that if you are not running <CODE>do_all</CODE>
you still need to run this stage first.  This is done by the
calls

<PRE>
    (format t "Loading utterances and sorting types\n")
    (set! utterances (acost:db_utts_load dt_params))
    (set! unittypes (acost:find_same_types utterances))
    (acost:name_units unittypes)
</PRE>

<P>
Though the function <CODE>do_init</CODE> will do the same thing.

</P>
<P>
This uses the following parameters
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>name</CODE>
<DD>
A name for this database.
<DT><CODE>db_dir</CODE>
<DD>
This full pathname of the database
<DT><CODE>utts_dir</CODE>
<DD>
The directory contain the utterances.
<DT><CODE>utts_ext</CODE>
<DD>
The file extention for the utterance files
<DT><CODE>files</CODE>
<DD>
The list of file ids in the database.
</DL>
<P>
For example for the KED example these parameters are

<PRE>
       (name 'ked_timit)
       (db_dir "/usr/awb/data/timit/ked/")
       (utts_dir "festival/utts/")
       (utts_ext ".utt")
       (files ("kdt_001" "kdt_002" "kdt_003" ... ))
</PRE>

<P>
The next stage is to load the accoustic parameters and build
the distance tables.  The acoustic distance between each segment
of the same type is calculated and saved in the distance table.
Precalculating this saves a lot of time as the cluster will require
this number many times.

</P>
<P>
This is done by the following two function calls

<PRE>
    (format t "Loading coefficients\n")
    (acost:utts_load_coeffs utterances)
    (format t "Building distance tables\n")
    (acost:build_disttabs unittypes clunits_params)
</PRE>

<P>
The following parameters influence the behaviour.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>coeffs_dir</CODE>
<DD>
The directory (from db_dir) that contains the acoustic coefficients
as generated by the script <TT>`make_mcep'</TT>.
<DT><CODE>coeffs_ext</CODE>
<DD>
The file extention for the coefficient files
<DT><CODE>get_std_per_unit</CODE>
<DD>
Takes the value <CODE>t</CODE> or <CODE>nil</CODE>.  If <CODE>t</CODE> the parameters
for the type of segment are normalized by finding the menas and
standard deviations for the class are used.  Thus a mean mahalanobis
euclidean distance is found between units rather than simply
a euclidean distance.
<DT><CODE>ac_left_context &#60;float&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
The amount of the previous unit to be included in the the distance.
1.0 means all, 0.0 means none.  This parameter may be used to make the
acoustic distance sensitive to the previous acoustic context.
<DT><CODE>ac_duration_penality &#60;float&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
The penalty factor for duration mismatch between units.
<DT><CODE>ac_weights (&#60;float&#62; &#60;float&#62; ...)</CODE>
<DD>
The weights for each parameter in the coefficeint files used
while finding the acoustic distance between segments.  There must
be the same number of weights as there are parameters in the
coefficient files.
</DL>
<P>
An example from KED is

<PRE>
       (coeffs_dir "festival/coeffs/")
       (coeffs_ext ".dcoeffs")
       (dur_pen_weight 0.1)
       (get_stds_per_unit t)
       (ac_left_context 0.8)

</PRE>

<P>
The next stage is to dump the feature staht will be used to index the
clusters.  Remember the clusters are defined with respect to the acoustic
distance between each unit in the cluster, but they are indexed by
these features.  These features are those which will be available at
text-to-speech time when no acoustic information is available.  Thus
they include things like phonetic and prosodic context rather than
spectral information.  The name features may (and probabaly should)
be over general alloing the decision tree building program <CODE>wagon</CODE>
to decide which of theses feature actual does have an acoustic
distinction in the units.

</P>
<P>
The function to dump the features is

<PRE>
    (format t "Dumping features for clustering\n")
    (acost:dump_features unittypes utterances clunits_params)
</PRE>

<P>
The parameters which affect this function are
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>fests_dir</CODE>
<DD>
The directory when the features will be saved (by segment type).
<DT><CODE>feats</CODE>
<DD>
The list of features to be dumped. These are standard festival
feature names with respect to the Segment relation.

<P>
Now that we have the acoustic distances and the feature descriptions of
each unit the next stage is to find a relationship between those
features and the acoustic distances.  This we do using the CART tree
builder <CODE>wagon</CODE>.  It will find out questions about which features
best minimize the acoustic distance between the units in that class.
<CODE>wagon</CODE> has many options many of which are apporiate to this task
though it is interesting that this learning task is interestingly
closed.  That is we are trying to classify <EM>all</EM> the units in
the database, there is no test set as such.  However in synthesis
there will be desired units whose feature vector didn't exist
in the training set. 

</P>
<P>
The clusters are built by the following function

<PRE>
    (format t "Building cluster trees\n")
    (acost:find_clusters (mapcar car unittypes) clunits_params)
</PRE>

<P>
The parameters that affect the tree building process are
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>tree_dir</CODE>
<DD>
the directory where the decision tree for each segment type will
be saved
<DT><CODE>wagon_field_desc &#60;file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
A filename of a weagon filed descriptor file.   This is a standard
field description (field name plus field type) that is require for
wagon.  This building process doesn't include an explicit building
of this file and you must create it yourself.  The script
<TT>`make_wagon_desc'</TT> can aid this given the feature files
in <TT>`festival/feats'</TT> and a file contains the feature

above.
<DT><CODE>wagon_progname &#60;file&#62;</CODE>

The pathname for the <TT>`wagon'</TT> CART building program.  This
is a string and may also include any extra parameters you
wish to give to <TT>`wagon'</TT> e.g. <CODE>-stepwise</CODE>.
<DT><CODE>wagon_cluster_size &#60;int&#62;</CODE>

Note that as the distance tables can be large there is an alternative
function that does both the ditance table and clustering in one,
deleting the distance table immediately after use, thus you only need
enough disk space for the largest number of phones in any type.
To do this 

<PRE>
    (acost:disttabs_and_clusters unittypes clunits_params)
</PRE>

<P>
Removing the calls to <CODE>acost:build_disttabs</CODE> and 
<CODE>acost:find_clusters</CODE>.

</P>
<P>
In our KED example these have the values

<PRE>
       (trees_dir "festival/trees/")
       (wagon_field_desc "festival/clunits/all.desc")
       (wagon_progname "/usr/awb/projects/speech_tools/bin/wagon")

The final stage in building a cluster model is collect the
generated trees into a single file and dumping the uniot
catalogue, i.e. the list of unit names and their files and
position in them.  This is doen by the lisp function

<PRE>
    (acost:collect_trees (mapcar car unittypes) clunits_params)
    (format t "Saving unit catalogue\n")
    (acost:save_catalogue utterances clunits_params)
</PRE>

<P>
The only parameter that affect this is
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>catalogue_dir</CODE>
<DD>
the directory where the catalogue will be save (the <CODE>name</CODE> 
parameter is used to name the file).
</DL>
<P>
In the KED example this is

<PRE>
       (catalogue_dir "festival/clunits/")
</PRE>

<P>
There are a number of parameters that are specified with a cluster
voice.  These are related to the run time aspects of the cluster
model.  These are
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>join_weights</CODE>
<DD>
This are a set of weights, in the same format as <CODE>ac_weights</CODE>
that are used in optimal coupling to find the best join point between two
candidate units.  This is different from <CODE>ac_weights</CODE> as it
is likely different values are desried, particularl increasing the 
F0 value (column 0).
<DT><CODE>continuity_weight &#60;float&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
The factor to multiply the join cost over the target cost.  This
is probabaly not very relevant given the the target cost is merely
the position from the cluster center.
<DT><CODE>optimal_coupling &#60;int&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>1</CODE> this uses optimal coupling and searches the cepstrum
vectors at each join point to find the best possible join point.
This is computationally expensive (as well as having to load in lots
of cepstrum files), but does give better results.
<DT><CODE>extend_selections &#60;int&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
If <CODE>1</CODE> then the selected cluster will be extended
to include any unit from the cluster of the previous segments
candidate units that has correct phone type.  This is experimental
but has shown its worth and hence is recommend.  This means
that instead of selecting just units selection is effectively
selecting the beginings of multiple segment units.  This option
encourages far longer units.
<DT><CODE>pm_coeffs_dir &#60;file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
The directory (from <CODE>db_dir</CODE>) where the pitchmarks are
<DT><CODE>pm_coeffs_ext &#60;file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
The file extension for the pitchmark files.
<DT><CODE>sig_dir &#60;file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Directory containing waveforms of the units (or residuals if
Residual LPC is being used, PCM waveforms is PSOLA is being used)
<DT><CODE>sig_ext &#60;file&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
File extention for waveforms/residuals
<DT><CODE>join_method &#60;method&#62;</CODE>
<DD>
Specify the method used for joining the selected units. Currently it
supports <CODE>simple</CODE>, a very naive joining mechanism, and
<CODE>windowed</CODE>, where the ends of the units are windowed using a
hamming window then overlapped (no prosodic modification takes place
though).  The other two possible values for this feature are <CODE>none</CODE>
which does nothing, and <CODE>modified_lpc</CODE> which uses the standard
UniSyn module to modify the selected units to match the targets.

<P>
This cluster method is just a waveform synthesizer it still requires a
text analysis and prosodic component.  The only restriction is that it
must generate the same sort of utterance structures as in your database.
This is because it features from utterances of that type which were used
to train the selection trees.  That is you can't use a front end that
uses different relation names and features.

</P>
<P>
Here we simply use the same front end as <CODE>ked_diphone</CODE> as it
is basically the same speaker.

</P>


<H3><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="festvox_toc.html#TOC60">9.1.7  Cluster Example</A></H3>

<P>
<A NAME="IDX175"></A>
A simple example of building a cluster unit selection synthesizer is
given in section <A HREF="festvox_10.html#SEC62">10  Limited domain synthesis</A>.  In that example the features
used in selection have been reduced and a few other simplying
assumptions have been made but the underlying structure is the same.
That is a good example to start from, then change the parameters as
fully described above to improve the selection criertia.

<P>
<A NAME="IDX176"></A>
<A NAME="IDX177"></A>
As touched on above the choice of an inventory of units can be viewed as
a line from a small inventory phones, to diphones, tripohones to
arbitrary units.  Though the direction you come from influences the
selection of the units from the database.  CHATR <CITE>campbell96</CITE> lies
firmly at the "arbitrary units" end of the spectrum.  Although it can
exclude bad units from its inventory it is very much <SAMP>`everything
minus some'</SAMP> view of the world.  Microsoft's Whistler <CITE>huang97</CITE> on
the other hand, starts off with a general database base but selects
typical units from it.  Thus its inventory is substantially smaller than
the full general database the units are extracted from.  At the other
end of the spectrum we have the fixed pre-sepcified inventory like
diphone synthesis as has bee described in the previous chapter.

</P>
<P>
In this section we'll give some examples of moving along the line
from the fixed pre-specified inventory to the words the more general
inventories but these techniques still have a strong component
of prespecification.

</P>
<P>
Firstly lets us assume you have a general database that is labelled with
utterances as described above.  We can extract a standard diphone
database from this general database, however unless the database was
specifically desgined, a general database is unlikely to have diphone
coverage.  Even when phonetically rich databases are used such as Timit
there is likely to be very few vowel-vowel diphones as they are
comparatively rare.  But as these diphone are rare we may be able to do
with out them and hence it is at least an interesting exercise to
extract an as complete as possible diphone index from a general
database.  

</P>
<P>
The simplest method is to linearly search for all phone-phone pairs in
the phone set through all utterances simply taking the first example.
Some same code is given in <TT>`src/diphone/make_diphs_index.scm'</TT>.
This basic idea is to load in all the utterances in a database, and
index each segment by is phone name and succeeding phone name.  Then
various selection techniques can be use to select from the multiple
candidates of each diphone (or you can split the indexing futher).
After selection a diphone index file can be saved.

</P>
<P>
The utterances to load are identified by a list of fileids.  For
example if the list of fileids (without parenthesis) is in
the file <TT>`etc/fileids'</TT>, the following will builds a diphone
index.

<PRE>
festival .../make_diphs_utts.scm
...
festival&#62; (set! fileids (load "etc/fileids" t))
...
festival&#62; (make_diphone_index fileids "dic/f2bdiph.est")
</PRE>

<P>
Note that as this diphone index will contain a number of holes
you will need to either augment it with <SAMP>`similar'</SAMP> diphones
or process your diphone selections through <CODE>UniSyn_module_hooks</CODE>
as described in the previous chapter.

</P>
<P>
As you complicate the selection, and the number of diphones you used
from the database you will need to complicate the names used to
identify the diphones themselves.  The convention of using underscores
for syllable internal consonant clusters and dollars for syllable
initial consonants can be followed, but you will need to go further if
you wish to start introducing new feature such as phrase finality and
stress.  Eventually going to a generized naming scheme (type and number)
as used by the cluster selection technique described above, will prove
worth while.  Also using CART trees, through hand written and fully
deterministic (one candidate at the leaves), will be a reasonable
algorithm to select between hand stipulated alternatives with
reasonable backoff strategies.

</P>
<P>
Another potential direction is to use the acoustic costs used in the
clustering methods described in the previous section.  These can be used
to identify what the most typical unit in a cluster are (the mean
distances from all other units are given in the leafs).  Pruning these
trees until the cluster only contain a single example should help to
improve synthesis, in that variation in the feature in the "diphone"
index will then be determined by the features specified in the cluster
train algorithm.  Of course though as you limit the number of distinct
units types the more prosodic modification will be required by your
signal processing algorithm, which requires that you have good pitch
marks.

</P>
<P>
If you already have an existing database but don't wish to go to full
unit selection, such techniques are probably quite feasible and worth
further investigation.
