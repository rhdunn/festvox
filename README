This is all ALPHA level code

Notes
  You need a patched version of 1.3.0 (and speech tools)
  or 1.3.1 when its released.

     tar zxvf festival-1.3.0.tar.gz
     patch -p0 < fest-1.3.0.1.patch
     tar zxvf speech_tools-1.1.0.tar.gz
     patch -p0 < sptools-1.1.0.1.patch

  You may not need the argument -p0 on some versions of patch

The variaous scripts refer to both the speech tools programs and
programs in this directory, in order for them to find the 
appropriate versions you should set the following two
environment variables.  ESTDIR should point to your
local versions of the speech tools and FESTVOXDIR
should point to this directory.  e.g. In bash these can
be set by 

export ESTDIR=/home/awb/projects/speech_tools/
export FESTVOXDIR=/home/awb/DOCS/reports/festvox/

in csh

setenv ESTDIR /home/awb/projects/speech_tools/
setenv FESTVOXDIR /home/awb/DOCS/reports/festvox/

There are also a few directory references to directories in Makefiles
that need to be fixed.
